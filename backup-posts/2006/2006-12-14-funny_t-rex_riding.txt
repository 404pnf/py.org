> WHAT is more pimp than rolling up in a 35,400,000 B.C. T-Rex with gold fronts and mad bling on the saddle? 

hmm, bling bling, i want to [pimp my ride](http://www.google.com/search?q=pimp+my+ride&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official) this way. haha 

我来解释一下。虽然解释起来花费时间，但解释一下，这篇也归到自我教育吧。；）

从简单来。t-rex就是Tyrannosaurus rex就是霸王龙？（我问）。gold fronts这里指大金牙，金门牙，这条龙整个呀都换金的了。mad bling的[bling我们已经解释过了](http://pengyou.rijiben.org/node/921)。mad就是很多，很牛的意思。看看t-rex脖子上挂的装饰：）saddle就是马鞍。

现在进入主题，今天是pimp。

pimp的本意是皮条。动词拉皮条，名词拉皮条的。

[define: pimp](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&newwindow=1&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&hs=wIy&q=define%3A+pimp&btnG=Search)
> " someone who procures customers for whores (in England they call a pimp a ponce)
> pander: arrange for sexual partners for others

> A pimp is an informal term for a man who runs a brothel or otherwise oversees prostitution. The female counterpart to a pimp is a madam. Typically, a pimp will solicit clients for, protect, and in other ways manage a prostitute in exchange for a commission on her earnings.
> en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimp"

现在你更多听到的pimp或者pimping是其他意思了。

> "Prostitution is the sale of sexual services (examples: oral sex, sexual intercourse) for money. A person selling sexual services is a prostitute, a type of sex worker. In a more general sense of the word, anyone selling their services for a cause thought to be unworthy can be described as prostituting themselves.
> en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimping"

任何为不值当的事情出卖自己的服务都可以称为在pimping。比如，我们现在很多人上班，就是pimp ourselves。

还有呢，在pimp my ride这种用法里面，在pimping做形容词用的时候，

> Urban Dictionary: pimp
> "6. 	pimp 	25 up, 93 down 	
> As an adjective: If somethin' is pimpin', it's pretty darn cool. It's probably something "normal" that's tricked out ghettolicious and gawdy.
> Basically, you look very ghettofab and blingbling."
> http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pimp

就是很酷的东西都可以成为pimping。

那么pimp my ride中做动词就是把我的车给整cool点。本身那个节目就是那个内容啦。

> However, as a verb
> 1.) to pimp something out is to *make* it look very ghettofab and all that nifty stuff in the above paragraph.
> 2.) to pimp is to advertise (generally, in an enthusiastic sense) or to call attention in order to bring acclaim to something; to promote.
