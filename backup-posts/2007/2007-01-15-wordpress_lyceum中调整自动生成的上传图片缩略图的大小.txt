# wordpress lyceum中调整自动生成的上传图片缩略图的大小

帮[dodo](http://dodo.rijiben.org)解决上传图片缩略图太小的问题。
我把默认的改为480x360的大小

发图方法

点击图片
在一个弹出窗口头2个选项
   使用缩略图
   链接到图片
的时候点发送到编辑器就可以了
如果那两个选项是使用原图和不链接
就点一下那个选项他就切换了

修改了代码后。新上传的图片就自动按照拟设定的新的大小生成所略图了。

以前上传的图片不自动改变大小。在wordpress中，你重新把他们发送到编辑器一下就可以了。在lyceum中，重新发布也不行。

我写了一封信给邮件列表。看看其他人是否有这种情况和如何解决的吧。信是这样的：



modification of inline-uploading.php to resize thumbnail image in lyceum doesn't affect previously uploaded images

This is a quirk.

modification of inline-uploading.php to resize thumbnail image in lyceum doesn't affect previously uploaded images

I follow the instruction below. It works on wordpress, hence, I assume it works on lycuem.

The inline_upload.php in lyceum is identical to that of wordpress. But after I change the values, nothing happens. 

Actually it works on lyceum but if doesn't affect the already uploaded images. In wordpress, all you need to do is to resend uploaded images to editor and they got resized. In lyceum, I resent uploaded images and nothing happened.

But images uploaded AFTER the modification got resized properly.

So, if you want resize the thumbnail size (the default is 128x 96 , that's too small, would be better to adjust it to 400 x 360 for the future release, or let's have a vote)  modified the code as early as possible.

Would somebody please confirm and/or fix this quirk?
