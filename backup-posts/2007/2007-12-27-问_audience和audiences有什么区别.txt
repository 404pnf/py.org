# 问 audience和audiences有什么区别

## audience和audiences
audience本身是可数名词，所以有单数、复数的形式。具体用法还要看语境。
e.g.Chaplin's films captivated audiences throughout the world.
e.g.The music was performed before an enthusiastic audience.

我开始觉得这个例子举得不错。

再看wordnet详细说明

The noun audience has 4 senses (first 2 from tagged texts)
                                       
1. (60) audience -- (a gathering of spectators or listeners at a (usually public) performance; "the audience applauded"; "someone in the audience began to cough")
2. (9) audience -- (the part of the general public interested in a source of information or entertainment; "every artist needs an audience"; "the broadcast reached an audience of millions")
3. hearing, audience -- (an opportunity to state your case and be heard; "they condemned him without a hearing"; "he saw that he had lost his audience")
4. consultation, audience, interview -- (a conference (usually with someone important); "he had a consultation with the judge"; "he requested an audience with the king")

没有出现audience的复数形式。本身audience都代表一个整体了。而且wn的famliarity中说“audience used as a noun is uncommon (polysemy count = 4)”。

再用google搜[audience audiences](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&newwindow=1&client=firefox-a&rls=com.ubuntu%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&hs=N5H&q=+audience+audiences&btnG=Search)
