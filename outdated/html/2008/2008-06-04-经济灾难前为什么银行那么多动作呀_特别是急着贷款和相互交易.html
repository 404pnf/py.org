<h2>经济灾难前为什么银行那么多动作呀（特别是急着贷款和相互交易）</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just before the crash of 1929 huge trusts operated by the largest banks on Wall Street were buying each other’s stock to try and delay the inevitable. It’s like the passengers of the Titanic trying to drink all the water in the ocean to avoid sinking. Just before the dot-com crash we saw similar banking desperation; banks were lending to zero-revenue and zero business plan start-ups to spend the loans as fast as they could to make it look like they were ‘growing’ and therefore worthy of an IPO. Before the recent mortgage meltdown and real estate crash, home builders were lending to buyers to buy already inflated (read: fraudulent) appraised houses with zero chance of getting repaid, but 100% chance of cashing out inflated stock options.

<p>今年的visa上市就属于类似动作。
近年的web2.0也很像，很像很像。简直就是一样。：）</p>
