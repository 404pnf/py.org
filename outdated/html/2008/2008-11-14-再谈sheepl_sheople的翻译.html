<p>再谈sheepl/sheople的翻译</p>

<p>指那种言听计从随大流的人。翻译成“很面的人”不确切。找不到合适的词。大家一起想想啊。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sheeple is a term of disparagement, a portmanteau created by combining the words “sheep” and “people.”</p>

  <p>It is often used to denote persons who acquiesce to authority, and thus undermine their own human individuality. The implication of sheeple is that as a collective, people believe whatever they are told, especially if told so by authority figures, without processing it to be sure that it is an accurate representation of the real world around them. The term is generally used in a political or religious sense. The singular form of the term is “sherson;” however, the plural form is most often used.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Sheeple 	</li>
  </ol>

  <p>People unable to think for themselves. Followers. Lemmings. Those with no cognitive ablilities of their own.
All the teens were wearing bell-bottoms because they were sheeple.

2. 	sheeple 	</p>

  <p>A individual that forfits their right to choose in favor of inclusion in groupthink and what is viewed as popular or elete group. Allowing the influences of different forms of media and group members to hold great sway in the formation of attitudes, behavoir and opinion.
To accept the group mentaility and opinion as fact without examination.
Not only to be told what to do, but accepting the paradigm of thought as absolute thereby removing the weight of personal responsibility in the making of decisions.
In 2003 American President Bush states that the need to invade Iraq is imperative because it it was a supporter of islamic terrorism and developer of Weapons of Mass Destruction that would threaten the United States.</p>

  <p>Although no evidence was given in support of such statements the american sheeple supported the war despite evidence to the contrary.
