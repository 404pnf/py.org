<p>googleplex是从googolplex来的这点我没想到。我一直以为只是简单的结合google和complex（楼群）这2个词呢。</p>

<h2>2个名字的缘由</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>The name “Google” originated from a misspelling of “googol,”[6][7] which refers to the number represented by a 1 followed by one-hundred zeros. Having found its way increasingly into everyday language, the verb, “google,” was added to the Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary in 2006, meaning, “to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet.”[8][9]</p>

  <p>[snip]</p>

  <p>After quickly outgrowing two other sites, the company leased a complex of buildings in Mountain View at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway from Silicon Graphics (SGI) in 1999.[12] The company has remained at this location ever since, and the complex has since become known as the Googleplex (a play on the word googolplex, a 1 followed by a googol of zeros). In 2006, Google bought the property from SGI for $319 million.[13]

<h2>什么是googole</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>A googol is the large number 10100, that is, the digit 1 followed by one hundred zeros (in decimal representation). The term was coined in 1938[1] by Milton Sirotta (1929–1980), nephew of American mathematician Edward Kasner. Kasner popularized the concept in his book Mathematics and the Imagination (1940).</p>

  <p>A googol can be written in conventional notation as follows:</p>

  <pre><code>1 googol
= 10100
= 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000 
</code></pre>

<h2>什么是googolplex</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>A googolplex is the number 10googol, which means it’s a 1 followed by a googol of zeros (i.e. 10100 zeros).</p>

  <pre><code>1 googolplex
= 10googol
= 10^{10^{100}}\,\!
= 1010,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
</code></pre>
