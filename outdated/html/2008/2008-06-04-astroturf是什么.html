<h2>astroturf是什么</h2>

<p>从一篇评论看到这个词astroturf, astroturfing, astroturfer。</p>

<p>这条评论很有说服力。</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>And I don’t see this as astroturfing. Posting anonymously is different from posting under a fake identity.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Bullshit. It’s posting in a way that’s intended to deceive the reader into thinking the message is by an average citizen and not paid propaganda. It’s fraud.</p>

  <p>Astroturfers are lying scum and should be in jail.</p>

  <p>Companies should have no right of anonymity and it’s about time the law caught up with them. All communication by corporate entities should be clearly identified as such. Corporations have a privileged legal position and with that privilege comes responsibility. In particular, transparency and accountability.</p>

  <p>Think it doesn’t matter? It does, or they wouldn’t do it.</p>

  <p>Corporate tools will claim that readers will not give them a fair hearing if they post under the corporate name. Well hello, guess why. If corporations were trustworthy they wouldn’t have a problem.</p>

  <p>Others will claim that the message should be evaluated independent of the messenger. Self serving nonsense, context is very important in evaluating the veracity of a message.</p>

<p>看wikipedia的解释。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Astroturfing
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Astroturfing in American English is a neologism for formal public relations campaigns in politics and advertising which seek to create the impression of being spontaneous, grassroots behavior, hence the reference to the artificial grass AstroTurf.</p>

  <p>The goal of such a campaign is to disguise the efforts of a political or commercial entity as an independent public reaction to some political entity—a politician, political group, product, service or event. Astroturfers attempt to orchestrate the actions of apparently diverse and geographically distributed individuals, by both overt (“outreach”, “awareness”, etc.) and covert (disinformation) means. Astroturfing may be undertaken by anything from an individual pushing one’s own personal agenda through to highly organized professional groups with financial backing from large corporations, non-profits, or activist organizations.</p>
