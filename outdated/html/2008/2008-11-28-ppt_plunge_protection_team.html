<h2>ppt: plunge protection team</h2>
<p>现在常听到的一个词。
ppt，或者叫 nice govt men，绝大情况下是把事情搞得更糟糕。
因为把你带入麻烦中的人怎么会把你带出麻烦呢。</p>

<h2>这个组织的正是名称是Working Group on Financial Markets</h2>
<blockquote>

  <p>Vincent Golia still is of the belief that there is no government intervention in the financial markets. (HMH Magazine)</p>

  <p>The Group was established explicitly in response to events in the financial markets surrounding 25October 19, 261987 (“27Black Monday”) to give recommendations for legislative and private sector solutions for “enhancing the integrity, efficiency, orderliness, and competitiveness of [United States] financial markets and maintaining investor confidence”.28[1]</p>
