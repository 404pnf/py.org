  <p>37 ido - interactively do things with buffers and files.</p>

  <p>Author: Kim F. Storm 
Based on: iswitchb by Stephen Eglen</p>

  <p>There is a different version of the package in Emacs 22 so it will
eventually be removed.</p>

  <p>This package features a faster way to switch buffers and get new
files.  To get the alternative switch-to-buffer and find-file functions
in this package bound to keys, do</p>

  <pre><code>  (ido-mode t)    or `M-x ido-mode'.
</code></pre>

  <p>As you type in a substring, the list of buffers or files currently
matching the substring are displayed as you type.  The list is ordered
so that the most recent buffers or files visited come at the start of
the list.</p>

  <p>The buffer or file at the start of the list will be the one visited
when you press return.  By typing more of the substring, the list is
narrowed down so that gradually the buffer or file you want will be at
the top of the list.  Alternatively, you can use 
and 
(or the
right and left arrow keys) to rotate buffer or file names in the list
until the one you want is at the top of the list.  Completion is also
available so that you can see what is common to all of the matching
buffers or files as you type.</p>
