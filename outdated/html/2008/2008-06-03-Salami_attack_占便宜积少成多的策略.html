  <p>Salami attack
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

  <p>A salami attack is a series of minor data-security attacks that together results in a larger attack. For example, a fraud activity in a bank where an employee steals a small amount of funds from several accounts, can be considered a salami attack.</p>

  <p>The main idea is to make the change as minuscule as possible so that any single transaction will go completely unnoticed, due in part to round-off and truncation error.[1][2]</p>

  <p>For example, a bank’s employee takes a 0.00001% commission on all transactions. Due to the small percentage taken the illicit commission will be extremely hard to detect, yet due to the sheer number of transactions processed, the employee will gain tremendously.</p>

  <p>Salami attacks don’t always involve stealing money, but at times involve information gathering. The salami technique can also refer to the act of aggregating small amounts of information.</p>

  <p>[edit] Famous Salami Attacks</p>

  <p>In 2008 a man was arrested (although for using fake names) for creating a 58,000 accounts which he used to collect money “from online brokerage firms, one cent at a time”.</p>

  <p>In Los Angeles in October 1998, the district attorneys charged four men with fraud for allegedly installing computer chips in gasoline pumps that cheated consumers by overstating the amounts pumped.[3]</p>

  <p>In January 1993, four executives of a rental-car franchise in Florida were charged with defrauding at least 47,000 customers using a salami technique.</p>
