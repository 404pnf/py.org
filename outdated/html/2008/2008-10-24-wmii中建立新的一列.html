  <p>4.2 Using columns</p>

  <p>As described earlier, wmii uses columns to arrange your windows. Your view already consists of a single column. Next, you will create a new column.</p>

  <p>In wmii columns always consists of at least a single client, thus to create a new column, you need at least two clients at hand.</p>

  <p>Now focus a client of your choice and press MOD-Shift-l, which moves the client rightwards. As you see, wmii creates a new column by dividing the view horizontally in two equally big areas. The focused client has been moved into the new column.</p>

  <p>If you close the last client of a column, the column is destroyed immediately. If the last client of the current view is closed, the view will be removed accordingly as well.</p>

  <p>If you press MOD-j to change focus, you will see that wmii actually cycles the focus in the current column only.</p>

  <p>To change the focus to a different column, you can press MOD-l (right) and MOD-h (left) respectively.</p>

  <p>It is also possible to swap adjacent clients among columns. To swap clients leftwards, press MOD-Control-h. To swap clients rightwards, press MOD-Control-l.</p>

  <p>4.3 What about layouts?</p>

  <p>Layouts arrange clients in a column. They are related to a single column. Thus it is possible to have different columns in one view, each using another layout.</p>

  <p>The default layout arranges each client of the column with equally vertical space. You can enable this layout with MOD-d (where the ``d’’ stands for default) explicitly.</p>

  <p>The stacking layout can be enabled with MOD-s. As you see now, there is only one client using as much space as possible, and only title-bars of the other clients displayed in the column. You can switch between the clients in the column using MOD-j.</p>

  <p>The max-layout maximises all clients to the same geometry as the column. Only the focused client is displayed at a time, all other clients are behind it. You can switch between the clients with MOD-j. </p>
