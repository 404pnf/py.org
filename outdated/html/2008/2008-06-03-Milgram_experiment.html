<h2>Milgram experiment</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Milgram experiment
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedi</p>

  <p>If at any time the subject indicated his desire to halt the experiment, he was given a succession of verbal prods by the experimenter, in this order:[1]</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Please continue.</li>
    <li>The experiment requires that you continue.</li>
    <li>It is absolutely essential that you continue.</li>
    <li>You have no other choice, you must go on.</li>
  </ol>

<p>著名的“百分之65的人会［干嘛干嘛］如果穿白大褂的人他们这么做的话”说法就来自这个试验。中间填充干嘛干嘛自然是个坏事，比如，虐待动物。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Professor Milgram elaborated two theories explaining his results:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The first is the theory of conformism, based on Solomon Asch’s work, describing the fundamental relationship between the group of reference and the individual person. A subject who has neither ability nor expertise to make decisions, especially in a crisis, will leave decision making to the group and its hierarchy. The group is the person’s behavioral model.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The second is the agentic state theory, wherein, per Milgram, the essence of obedience consists in the fact that a person comes to view himself as the instrument for carrying out another person’s wishes, and he therefore no longer sees himself as responsible for his actions. Once this critical shift of viewpoint has occurred in the person, all of the essential features of obedience follow.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
