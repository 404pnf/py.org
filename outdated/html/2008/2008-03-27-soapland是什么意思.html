<h2>soapland是什么意思</h2>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Pornography, masturbation aids, Internet porn sites and social networks that lead to “virtual relationships”, soaplands and Japan’s widespread prostitution industry all allow men outlets for sexual fulfillment while not fulfilling other needs, such as procreation. The alarming trend has led medical experts in Japan to coin a new term for a condition they call “vaginal ejaculation dysfunctional disorder”.</p>

<p>WTF? VEDD?!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Soapland (ソープランド, sōpurando?) is a Japanese word for a type of brothel where men (hereinafter called “client”) can be bathed with female prostitutes (hereinafter called “companion”, although there are a few specifically for female clientèle.[1] Soaplands are special in the idea that a companion’s work room has two areas in it. One is a small area with a small couch and bed, and the other is a large shower room that has a large bath and floor for an inflatable mattress.

  <p>Legal status</p>

  <p>Article 3 of the Anti-Prostitution Law of 1956 states that “No person may either do prostitution or become the customer of it”, but no judicial penalty is defined for this act. Instead, the following are prohibited on pain of penalty: soliciting for purposes of prostitution, procuring a person for prostitution, coercing a person into prostitution, receiving compensation from the prostitution of others, inducing a person to be a prostitute by paying an “advance”, concluding a contract for making a person a prostitute, furnishing a place for prostitution, engaging in the business of making a person a prostitute, and the furnishing of funds for prostitution.</p>

  <p>However, the definition of prostitution is strictly limited to coitus. This means sale of numerous sex acts such as oral sex, anal sex, intercrural sex and other non-coital sex acts are all legal. The Businesses Affecting Public Morals Regulation Law of 1948 (Fūzoku eigyō torishimari hō (風俗営業取締法, Fūzoku eigyō torishimari hō?)), amended in 1985 and 1999, regulates these businesses.</p>
