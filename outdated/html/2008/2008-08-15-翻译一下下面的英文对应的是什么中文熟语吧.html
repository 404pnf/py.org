<p>翻译一下下面的英文对应的是什么中文熟语吧 ：）</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dr Dragan Dabic’s website is still online. In addition to noting that Dr Dragan Dabic “settled in China where he specialized in alternative medicine, with a special emphasis on the mind-body control, meditation, Yoga, spiritual cleansing, as well as Chinese herbs”, the website lists the dodgy doctor’s ten favorite “Chinese proverbs” in English.</p>

  <p>They are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Behind every able man, there are always other able men.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Teacher opens the door, but you must enter by yourself.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A wise man makes his own decisions, an ignorant man follows the public opinion.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>He who cannot agree with his enemies is controlled by them.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>If your strength is small, don’t carry heavy burdens. If your words are worthless, don’t give advice.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A flawed diamond is better than a common stone that is perfect.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Learning is a treasure that will follow its owner everywhere.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>If you are planning for a year, sow rice; if you are planning for a decade, plant trees; if you are planning for a lifetime, teach people.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>You cannot prevent the birds of sorrow from flying over your head, but you can prevent them from building nests in your hair.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>He who turns in his own, shall dig two graves.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

<p>我不感兴趣此人是谁。也对其另类意料十分怀疑！但我想试试自己是否能找出上面对应的中文熟语。：）</p>

<p>现在开始：</p>

<p>人外有人</p>

<p>师傅令进门，修行在个人</p>

<p>A wise man makes his own decisions, an ignorant man follows the public opinion.</p>

<p>He who cannot agree with his enemies is controlled by them.</p>

<p>If your strength is small, don’t carry heavy burdens. If your words are worthless, don’t give advice.</p>

<p>暇不掩瑜</p>

<p>艺不压身 ？？</p>

<p>If you are planning for a year, sow rice; if you are planning for a decade, plant trees; if you are planning for a lifetime, teach people.</p>

<p>You cannot prevent the birds of sorrow from flying over your head, but you can prevent them from building nests in your hair.</p>

<p>He who turns in his own, shall dig two graves.</p>

<p>没翻译的都是我不知道是什么？</p>

<p>大家帮忙！</p>
