<blockquote>
  <p>Wade-Giles pronounced /ˌweɪdˈʤaɪlz/ (simplified Chinese: 威妥玛拼音 or 韦氏拼音; traditional Chinese: 威妥瑪拼音 or 韋氏拼音; pinyin: wēituǒmǎ pīnyīn), sometimes abbreviated Wade, is a Romanization system (phonetic notation and transcription) for the Chinese language based on the form of Mandarin used in Beijing. It developed from a system produced by Thomas Wade in the mid-19th century, and reached settled form with Herbert Giles’s Chinese-English dictionary of 1892.</p>

  <p>Wade-Giles was the main system of transcription in the English-speaking world for most of the 20th century, used in several standard reference books and in all books about China published before 1979.[1] It replaced the Nanjing-based romanization systems that had been common until late in the 19th century. It has mostly been replaced by the pinyin system today, but parts of it, especially the names of individuals and certain cities remain in use in the Republic of China (Taiwan).Wade-Giles pronounced /ˌweɪdˈʤaɪlz/ (simplified Chinese: 威妥玛拼音 or 韦氏拼音; traditional Chinese: 威妥瑪拼音 or 韋氏拼音; pinyin: wēituǒmǎ pīnyīn), sometimes abbreviated Wade, is a Romanization system (phonetic notation and transcription) for the Chinese language based on the form of Mandarin used in Beijing.

<p>wikipedia entry on pinyin</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pinyin, more formally Hanyu Pinyin, is the most common Standard Mandarin romanization system in use. Hanyu means the Chinese language[1], and pinyin means “spell sound”, or the spelling of the sound.[2]</p>

  <p>Pinyin uses the Latin alphabet to represent sounds in Standard Mandarin. The way these letters represent sounds in Standard Mandarin does not correspond to any other one particular language that uses the Roman alphabet. For example, the sounds indicated in pinyin by b and g correspond more closely to the sounds indicated by p and k in some Western uses of the Latin script, e.g., French. Other letters, like j, q, x or zh, indicate sounds that do not correspond to any exact sound in English. Some of the transcriptions in pinyin, such as the ian ending, do not correspond to English pronunciations, either. This means that people who have not studied Chinese, or who have studied Chinese but not the pinyin system, are likely to severely mispronounce some words if they attempt to pronounce pinyin according to their own language spellings. However, this very disregard for conventional pronunciations of the letters has enabled pinyin to represent Chinese sounds with economy and internal consistency.</p>

  <p>Why “Beijing” Now, Not “Peking” Any More?</p>

  <p>To answer this question, we may have to look back about 40 years. In 1953 English (or Roman) letters were adopted as the phonetic symbols to replace the traditional Chinese ones. The new Romanized phonetic system is called Pinyin (combined phonetic syllables). Besides Pinyin, there had already existed a Romanization system known as the Wade-Giles system that was first devised by Thomas Francis Wade in 1859 and later revised by Herbert Allen Giles in 1892. The spelling in these two systems was not always consistent. Thus, for each name of a person or a city there were usually two different spellings (such as Mao Tse-tung in Wale system, and Mao Zedong in PinYin.)</p>

  <p>Since Pinyin was successfully used in education and became a popular alternative in so many places, such as publications, advertisements, and trade marks, the Education Ministry, in 1978, promulgated a consensus standard for the Romanization of Chinese characters. Namely, to use Pinyin as the official system and to abolish Wade-Giles. From then on, Peking became Beijing, even though its Chinese name was not changed. Hsi’an became Xi’an; Mao Tse-Tung became Mao Zedong, however, “China” remains unchanged. Taiwan recognized the Pinyin system only recently.</p>
