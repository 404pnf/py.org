## counterparty risk
&gt; 交易对手风险
&gt; 
&gt; 
## Credit risk
&gt; From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
&gt; 
&gt; Credit risk is the risk of loss due to a debtor’s non-payment of a loan or other line of credit (either the principal or interest (coupon) or both)
&gt; 
&gt; 
## counterparty
&gt; 
&gt; A counterparty (sometimes contraparty) is a legal and financial term. It means a party to a contract. A counterparty is usually the entity with whom one negotiates on a given agreement, and the term can refer to either party or both, depending on context.
&gt; 
&gt; Any legal entity can be a counterparty. Examples of legal entities are a person, a married couple, a corporation, a limited partnership, a city, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Usually, to say that there are counterparties to an arrangement means that there is some potential for conflict between them. Well-drafted contracts usually attempt to spell out in explicit detail what each counterparty’s rights and obligations are in every conceivable circumstance, though there are of course limits. There are general provisions for how counterparties are treated under the law, and (at least in common law legal systems) there are large amounts of case law to refer to for legal precedents.</p>
