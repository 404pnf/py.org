  <p>Thanksgiving
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>

  <p>Thanksgiving, or Thanksgiving Day, is a traditional 22North American 23holiday, which is a form of 24harvest festival. The date and whereabouts of the first Thanksgiving celebration is a topic of modest contention, though the earliest attested Thanksgiving celebration was on 25September 8, 1565 in what is now 26Saint Augustine, Florida.27[1] Despite scholarly research to the contrary, the traditional “first Thanksgiving” is venerated as having occurred at the site of 28Plymouth Plantation, in 1621.</p>

  <p>Today, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the second Monday of October in 29Canada and on the fourth Thursday of November in the 30United States. 31Thanksgiving dinner is done in the evening, usually as a gathering of friends and/or family. At this time you say all your thanks and wishes.</p>
