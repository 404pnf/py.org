<p>resilient是什么意思</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“Not only have individual financial institutions become less vulnerable to shocks from underlying risk factors, but also the financial system as a whole has become more resilient.”</p>

    <p>—Alan Greenspan, former Federal Reserve chairman, 2004</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The quote above is from a NYT article this morning, that, while not gutting and filleting Easy Al, it certainly questions his judgment and challenges his legacy. The NYT has finally gotten around to what many of us in the finance field have known for a very very long time: That Greenspan was not only a terrible Fed chief, he was a downright dangerous one.</p>
