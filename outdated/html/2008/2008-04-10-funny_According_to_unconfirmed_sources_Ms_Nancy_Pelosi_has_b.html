<h2>funny: According to unconfirmed sources, Ms. Nancy Pelosi has been given the highest honor, “The People’s Hero Medal” by the Propaganda Department of Chinese Communist Party Central Committee.</h2>

  <p>I apologize for missing April 1st to share this piece about awards that somebody sent to me through email.</p>

    <li>
      <p>According to unconfirmed sources, Ms. Nancy Pelosi has been given the highest honor, “The People’s Hero Medal” by the Propaganda Department of Chinese Communist Party Central Committee. This award was given for her “unique and outstanding contribution in strengthening CCP central leadership by stirring up profound hatred and suspicion among the Chinese people against the USA government and US democracy”.</p>
    </li>

      <p>According to a unconfirmed secret report from the Chinese State Security Ministry, the senior leadership team of CNN was recognized Tuesday in a closed door working session of the Standing Committee of CCP Political Bureau. Chairman Hu expressed his appreciations for the “underground party comrades working at CNN as editors and writers. They did an excellent job of distorting facts about what happened in Tibet. Their work powerfully assisted us in helping the Chinese people to see clearly that their enemies were Western democracies and Western governments, and Western medias are liars while the party always tells the truth. I have instructed the State Security Ministry to send an encrypted message about my thanks to the CCP CNN General Committee: good job, comrades, and the way to go! However, the final victory of the revolution has not been won and comrades at CNN have to work harder to provoke the Chinese people.”</p>

      <p>The generals of the Chinese Liberation Army sent many bottles of high quality French wine made in 1949 to their friends in Pentagon to thank them for periodically sending US aircraft battle groups to Taiwan Strait and deploying high performance stealth bombers and fighters in Japan. One Chinese air force general called his US counterpart and shared a grateful moment: “Thank you so much, my friend and it worked as we planned. When I told the boss in Beijing that your F-35 stealth fighter bomber deployed in Japan could break through all Chinese air defenses and threat the safety of leadership compound in Beijing, his face suddenly was frozen. Soon, I got 30 billion US dollars to buy and build long range precision cruise missiles that can attack and destroy aircraft carriers and land based air force bases. Thank you so much, old buddy, you are such a true friend. I will do my part too as we agreed. I will do an ISBC missiles test next month working with the Second Artillery commander in chief to help with that budget increase proposal of yours.”</p>
