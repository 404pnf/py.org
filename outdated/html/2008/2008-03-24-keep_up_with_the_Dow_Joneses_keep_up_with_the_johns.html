<h2>keep up with the Dow Joneses ; keep up with the johns</h2>

<p>喜欢这句。这是什么修辞手法啊。音相近的两个词替换。不但读着好听，而且意思也很明确。有意思。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consumers bought goods with no money down and financed those obligations at zero percent.</p>

  <p>Many used homes as collateral and flipped into adjustable-rate mortgages at the urging of Alan Greenspan.</p>

  <p>Total debt in this country rose to more than 400% of GDP as societal spending habits lost all semblance of consequence.</p>

  <p>As Americans raced to keep up with the Dow Joneses, seeds of discontent percolated under the seemingly calm financial surface. All the while, the cumulative imbalances grew as society chased the bigger, better thing. The real (inflation-adjusted) median income is lower now than at the beginning of the expansion. That means overall income gains have been stagnant for this expansion.
