      <h1>AFI s 100 Years 100 Movie Quotes</h1>

<p>Part of the AFI 100 Years… series, AFI’s 100 Years… 100 Movie Quotations is a list of the top 100 movie quotations in American cinema. The American Film Institute revealed the list on June 21, 2005, in a three-hour television program on CBS. The program was hosted by actor Pierce Brosnan and had commentary from many Hollywood actors and filmmakers.</p>

<p>A jury consisting of 1,500 film artists, critics, and historians selected “Frankly, my dear, I don’t give a damn,” spoken by Clark Gable in the Civil War epic Gone with the Wind as the most memorable American movie quotation of all time.
