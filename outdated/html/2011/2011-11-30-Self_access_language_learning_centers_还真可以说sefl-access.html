      <h1>Self access language learning centers 还真可以说sefl-access</h1>

<p>Self access language learning centers are educational facilities designed for student learning that is at least partially, if not fully self-directed. Students have access to resources ranging from photocopied exercises with answer keys to computer software for language learning. These centers are an outgrowth of a style of learning that can go by several names: learner-centered approach, learner autonomy or self-directed learning. These centers exist primarily in Asia, Europe and North America. Use of such facilities and the pedagogical theory they are based upon has its advantages and disadvantages. Proper use can result in a feeling of empowerment and better learning outcomes, but getting to the point where students and teachers can exploit them effectively can be problematic. For this reason, the structure of established self access centers varies from completely student-directed work with classroom immersion to those which provide primarily tutor or instructor guidance for student work.

<p>我开始看到这个表述觉得是错误的。因为我觉得如果从self-serve来推倒，serve sb，那么就是这里sb就是self，因此就是serve yourself，就是自我帮助，就是自助。同理，acess sth，那么这里是access yourself，就是访问/接触自己，就是自访问？！。那肯定意思不对。但是我错了。可以这么说的。</p>
