  <p>After he read a book that he didn’t understand, David Brooks came up with another crackpot distortion of capitalism.

<p>more quote from the same article
&gt; As anyone who reads The Wall Street Journal knows, hedge fund managers get rich because of the “Heads-I-win-tails-I-don’t-lose” fee structure paid by their investors. Typically, they charge a 2% management fee, plus they take 20% of all profits. The fund manager only shares in the profits, not the losses. So his primary incentive is to seek a big short-term upside, rather than to limit downside risk.</p>
