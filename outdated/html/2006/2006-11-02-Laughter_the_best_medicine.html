      <h1>Laughter the best medicine</h1>

<p>最近在《Reader’s Digest》中，发现了几则小笑话，与大家分享。笑一笑吧，千万别十年少，那样可就笑不了几次了。：）</p>

<p><strong>During an interview</strong>
, a reporter asked the bank president for the secret of his success.
“Two words.”
“And what are they?”
“Right decisions.”
“How are right decisions made?”
“One word.”
“What is that?”
“Experience.”
“How do you get experience?”
“Two words.”
“What are they?”
“Wrong decisions.”</p>

<p><strong>Two engineers applied</strong>
for one job at a computer company. They had identical qualifications, so to determine which one to hire, the firm gave them a test. Each missed only one question.</p>

<p>A manager called the first candidate and said, “We’re going with the other applicant.”
“Why? We both got nine questions right,” said the reject.
“Our choice isn’t based on the correct answers, but on the question you both missed,” said the manager.
“How would one incorrect answer be better than the other?” the applicant inquired.
“Simple,” said the manager.
“For question No.5, the other guy put down, ‘I don’t know.’ You wrote,’Neither do I.’”</p>
