  <p>Scripting News: 12/24/2006
“And Sean offers no response to the crucial question I asked, the one that cuts to the core of Microsoft’s intentions. And even if he had responded, he’s not an officer of the company, and his word isn’t binding. His predecessor, a former Microsoft employee, now works at Google. Next week Sean could be working at another company, and his successor could say, when we show him or her how much Sean liked us, “Okay, now what?” And he or she would be right. There’s little if anything in Sean’s letter that we can take to court.</p>

  <p>To those that say the patent is only defensive, note that even though Sean’s word would not be binding, he doesn’t offer that assurance himself.</p>

  <p>I think now would be a great time to hear from Ray Ozzie. He is an officer of the company. His word, if given in writing, would be binding on the company. Microsoft isn’t taking this seriously, by sending their response back through Sean, if that’s how we’re meant to understand this.”
