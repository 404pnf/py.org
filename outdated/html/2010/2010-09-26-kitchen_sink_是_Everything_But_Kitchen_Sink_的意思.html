      <h1>kitchen sink 是 Everything But Kitchen Sink 的意思</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everything But Kitchen Sink ( almost everything has been included … )
“everything but kitchen sink”</p>

  <p>Everything but the kitchen sink is what you brought with you when you included almost everything you could think to bring. Example: “Wow, your suitcase is huge. What do you have in there? Everything but the kitchen sink?” </p>

  <p>When we we are deciding what to bring with us, we try to take everything possible. But some things, like the kitchen sink, are just not convenient. Example: “Every time we go camping my wife packs everything but the kitchen sink.” </p>

  <p>Everything but the kitchen sink means that you included almost everything you could think to include. Example: “My dad’s new luxury car is great. It has everything but the kitchen sink.”
