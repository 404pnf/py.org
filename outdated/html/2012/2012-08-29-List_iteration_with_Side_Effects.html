      <h1>List iteration with Side Effects</h1>

<p>If you loop over a list, it’s best to avoid changing the list in the loop body. To give you an example, what can happen, have a look at the following example:
colours = [“red”]
for i in colours:
    if i == “red”:
        colours += [“black”]
    if i == “black”:
        colours += [“white”]
print(colours)
What will be printed by “print colours”?
[‘red’, ‘black’, ‘white’]
To avoid these side effects, it’s best to work on a copy by using the slicing operator, as can be seen in the next example:
colours = [“red”]
for i in colours[:]:
    if i == “red”:
        colours += [“black”]
    if i == “black”:
        colours += [“white”]
print(colours)
Now the output looks like this:
[‘red’, ‘black’]
We still might have done something, what we shouldn’t have done. We changed the list “colours”, but our change hasn’t had any effect on the loop anymore. The elements to be looped remained the same during the iterations. </p>
