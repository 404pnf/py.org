<p>from the song The Greatest Love of All</p>

<p>整个歌词都很美。</p>

<pre><code>  "Greatest Love Of All"
  
  I believe the children are our future
  Teach them well and let them lead the way
  Show them all the beauty they possess inside
  Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
  Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
  
  Everybody's searching for a hero
  People need someone to look up to
  I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
  A lonely place to be
  So I learned to depend on me
  
  [Chorus:]
  I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadows
  If I fail, if I succeed
  At least I'll live as I believe
  No matter what they take from me
  They can't take away my dignity
  Because the greatest love of all
  Is happening to me
  I found the greatest love of all
  Inside of me
  The greatest love of all
  Is easy to achieve
  Learning to love yourself
  It is the greatest love of all
  
  I believe the children are our future
  Teach them well and let them lead the way
  Show them all the beauty they possess inside
  Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
  Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
  
  [Chorus]
  
  And if, by chance, that special place
  That you've been dreaming of
  Leads you to a lonely place
  Find your strength in love
