  # If this wasn't such a trivial program, I'd include all that stuff about
  # no warrantee, free use, etc. from the GNU General Public License.  If you
  # want to be picky, assume that all of its terms apply.  Okay?

  # parentheses, brackets, etc.
  s=[][(){}]= &amp; =g
  # Some taggers, such as Adwait Ratnaparkhi's MXPOST, use the parsed-file
  # version of these symbols.
  # UNCOMMENT THE FOLLOWING 6 LINES if you're using MXPOST.

  # you might someday want to know how the words originally fit together --
  # but it's too late to make a better system now, given the millions of
  # words we've already done "wrong".
