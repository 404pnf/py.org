      <h1>Shiting You 尤诗婷</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>The photograph, however, shows two bumper cars. What then, is this mysterious “Super pen pen car” that the sign is advertising? In fact, “pen pen” is incorrect pinyin for pèngpèng 碰碰 (“bump”), and a pèngpèngchē 碰碰车 is a “bumper car” ride that you can often find in Chinese amusement parks.</p>

  <p>Many pinyin-English faux amis are humorous. For example, there’s a girl named You Shiting 尤诗婷. When she came to America to study, her name was given in the usual Western order as Shiting You, which led to much merriment.</p>

  <p>When I first went to China in 1981, I was tricked by some naughty girls who kept asking me how to pronounce fuxing 復興 (“rebirth, renaissance, resurgence”) and what it meant in English. A major hotel in Beijing had to change its name from Fuxing Hotel to Beijing Hotel because tourists were reluctant to stay in it when it had the former appellation.</p>
