<p>哈奴曼

<p>赤陶质地的哈奴曼像
哈奴曼（हनुमत्；Hanuman），印度史詩《羅摩衍那》的神猴，擁有四張臉和八支手，解救阿逾陀國王子羅摩之妻悉多，與羅剎惡魔羅波那大戰。</p>

<p>羅摩是大神毗濕奴化身。羅摩之妻悉多非常美麗，被楞伽城十頭魔王羅波那用計劫走。羅摩在尋妻途中助猴王須羯哩婆奪得王位。猴王派手下大將哈努曼，隨羅摩去尋妻。哈奴曼勇敢機敏，能騰雲駕霧，火燒楞伽宮，盜仙草，終於幫助羅摩征服了強敵，救出悉多。</p>

<p>胡適認為《西遊記》的美猴王孫悟空原型就是取自哈奴曼，他說：“我總疑心這個神通廣大的猴子不是國貨，乃是一件從印度進口的。也許連無支祁的神話也是受了印度影響而倣造的。”又說，「我依著鋼和泰博士的指引，在印度最古的記事詩《拉麻傳》裡尋得一個哈奴曼，大概可以算是齊天大聖的背影了」[1]。隨著印度佛教東傳中國，《羅摩衍那》記載的「楞伽城大戰」中大鬧無憂園的情節，就被改編成《西游记》中孫悟空大闹天宫的故事。陳寅恪與季羨林[2]皆同意此說法。吳曉鈴在《〈西遊記〉和〈羅摩延書〉》一文對孫悟空受哈努曼影響說提出異議。</p>

<p>英文： http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanuman</p>

<p>Hanuman was mischievous in his childhood, and sometimes teased the meditating sages in the forests by snatching their personal belongings and by disturbing their well-arranged articles of worship. Finding his antics unbearable, but realizing that Hanuman was but a child, (albeit invincible), the sages placed a mild curse on him by which he became unable to remember his own ability unless reminded by another person. It is hypothesised that without this curse, the entire course of the Ramayana war might have been different, for he demonstrated phenomenal abilities during the war. The curse is highlighted in Kishkindha Kanda and Sundara Kanda when Jambavantha reminds Hanuman of his abilities and encourages him to go and find Sita.[4] The specific verse that is recited by Jambavantha is:
You are as powerful as the wind;
You are intelligent, illustrious &amp; an inventor.
There is nothing in this world that’s too difficult for you;
Whenever stuck, you are the one who can help.

<p>In the Hindu epic the Ramayana we read the tale of Rama, an incarnation of the god Vishnu (the Preserver). Rama is a warrior and king, and was married to the lovely Sita. However, the evil demon king Ravana kidnapped Sita, and thus the plot of the Ramayana develops - Rama must rescue his beloved wife. He begins the search, but is unable to locate her. He does, however, come upon a monkey who prostrates himself before Rama and recognizes him as lord of the universe. This is the monkey Hanuman. He joins Rama in his search, and after leaping across the sea he finds Sita in Lanka, the kingdom of Ravana. While Rama makes his way there, Hanuman lets Sita know that he is a messenger of Rama and helps to console her. Ravana learns of Hanuman’s presence on the island and sends his son to capture him. The demon king lights Hanuman’s tail on fire as punishment, but the nimble Hanuman leaps from rooftop to rooftop, using his tail to burn down many buildings and kill many demons. Rama arrives, rescues Sita and destroys Ravana, and the three reunite.
