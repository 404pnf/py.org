      <h1>upgrade ubuntu gnu/linux over ssh</h1>

<p>I always did release upgrade through ssh, today I noticed this msg.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reading cache</p>

  <p>Checking package manager</p>

  <p>Continue running under SSH? </p>

  <p>This session appears to be running under ssh. It is not recommended 
to perform a upgrade over ssh currently because in case of failure it 
is harder to recover. </p>

  <p>If you continue, an additional ssh daemon will be started at port 
‘1022’. 
Do you want to continue? </p>

  <p>Continue [yN] y</p>

  <p>Starting additional sshd </p>

  <p>To make recovery in case of failure easier, an additional sshd will 
be started on port ‘1022’. If anything goes wrong with the running 
ssh you can still connect to the additional one. </p>

  <p>To continue please press [ENTER]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>good to know.  Just in case.</p>
