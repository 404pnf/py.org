<h2>XAH LEE的来历</h2>

<p>xah lee 可能是李杀的意思</p>

<p>near the bottom of the page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>我的名子叫李杀

</blockquote>

<p>希望是个代号，不然这名字起的～。：）</p>

<p>果然，这不是他的名字。他挑选这个3个字母是因为XAH这3个字母都上对称的。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Btw, the name “XAH” is by design. It is not a Chinese transliteration. I choose XAH as my English legal name. I wanted a unique name. Out of myriad letter combinations, XAH came to be more or less because I am fascinated by symmetric alphabets since young. There are still a lot possibilities of names with symmetric letters, but XAH seems to be good and was chosen.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It would be fun to write a program to generate all plausible names that are composed of symmetric letters. Anyone risen for the challenge?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>By the way, alphabet may have vertical mirror symmetry (A, M, U…) or horizontal (B, C, E…) or 2-fold rotational symmetry (N, Z, S), or 4-fold rotational symmetry with mirror (X, I), or diagonal symmetry (idealized L, Q), or a combination of the above (H, I, O). We might also consider lower cases. For example C, O, I … has the property that the symmetry is invariant among lower or upper cases. Symmetry are exhibited in whole words in different ways. E.g. AHA, WOW; MOW, pod; DO, COX, BEE, EXCEED; DID, DEED; civic, eve, eye. When applied to sentences in left/right mirror without regards to letter shapes, it’s called palindrome. That is, sentences that reads the same forward or backward. E.g. “god”, “A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!”. There are palindromes that are pages long, and I know there are books collecting it as wordy games.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>By the by the way, speaking of symmetry… The mathematical study of symmetry is called group theory. Group theory is the abstraction of abstractions. Its beauty surpasses that of visual. Just about few years ago, I was very puzzled by such a idea. How could math, with all the formula and precision, codify such a non-numeric concept as symmetry? What’s there to study about symmetry? Isn’t it just all ‘looks’? Indeed, knowing what it’s about has been a extreme satisfaction for me.</p>
