      <h1>bug fix textile 2 plugin for wordpress lyceum chinese and accented characters can t display properly</h1>

<p>Textile 2 plugin for wordpress works out of box with lyceum 0.34, if your are using english.</p>

<p>But there’s a bug in textile:</p>

<p>If you are using Chinese, like me, or language with accented characters, it misbehaves. Chinese become unreognized characters.</p>

<p>Here’s how to fix it:</p>

<p>edit textile.php, search for keyword “char_encoding “</p>

<p>you will see</p>

<pre><code>   // head_offset sets the amount to increase     header level (i.e. h1. be$
       $textile-&gt;options['head_offset'] = $this-&gt;settings['0'];
       $textile-&gt;options['char_encoding'] = $this-&gt;settings['Encoding'];
       $textile-&gt;options['input_encoding'] = $this-&gt;settings['InputEncoding];
</code></pre>

<p>Change Encoding and InputEncoding to language code you are using, e.g utf-8, as it’s the default with lyceum installation? Anyway, I always use utf-8.</p>

<p>Porblem fixed.</p>

If you are using UTF-8, changing the char_encoding option is recomended and it works well.

There were two things going on here. First, the module did not specify utf-8 as the charset for the Textile class. Second, there was a bug in TextilePHP that caused it to ignore false values for char_encoding. This is all addressed in the latest files in CVS. The lastest version for both 4.5 and 4.6 should work properly.</p>

<p>This is an obscure bug. I couldn’t search anything useful in google. At last I turn to drupal.org because I know drupal ported it as a module. I read issues with that module and found out how to fix it.</p>
