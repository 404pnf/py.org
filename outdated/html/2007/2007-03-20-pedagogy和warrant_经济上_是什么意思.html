&gt; education: the activities of educating or instructing; activities that impart knowledge or skill; “he received no formal education”; “our instruction was carefully programmed”; “good classroom teaching is seldom rewarded”

The Latin word for pedagogy, education, is much more widely used, and often the two are used interchangeably.

The right to buy the underlying instrument is referred to as a call warrant; the right to sell it is known as a put warrant. In this way a warrant is very similar to an option. The difference is primarily that the length of time available to exercise a warrant is much longer than most option contracts. …
