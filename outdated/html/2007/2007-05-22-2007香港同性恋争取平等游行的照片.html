<p>rainbow象征同性恋可以说是从旧金山来。它那里有个去都插着彩虹旗。Why rainbow/彩虹我没有dig up过。请大家来帮忙吧。</p>

<p>BTW, rainbow probably signify a spectrum, covering all LGBT.</p>

<p>parade这种游行一般都是快乐的，庆祝性的。通常会穿比较夸张的服饰，有时还有游车。&gt;http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Aparade

<p>A parade is an organized procession of people along a street, often in costume, and often accompanied by floats or sometimes large lighter-than-air balloons with complex shapes. Parades are held for a wide range of reasons, but are usually celebrations of some kind.</p>

<p>不是protest那种抗议似的游行。</p>

<blockquote>
  <h1>a formal and solemn declaration of objection; “they finished the game under protest to the league president”; “the senator rose to register his protest”; “the many protestations did not stay the execution”</h1>
  <p># utter words of protest
# the act of protesting; a public (often organized) manifestation of dissent
# express opposition through action or words; “dissent to the laws of the country”
# the act of making a strong public expression of disagreement and disapproval; “he shouted his protests at the umpire”; “a shower of protest was heard from the rear of the hall”
# affirm or avow formally or solemnly; “The suspect protested his innocence”

</blockquote>

<p>Protest expresses relatively overt reaction to events or situations: sometimes in favour, more often opposed. Protesters may organize a protest as a way of publicly and forcefully making their opinions heard in an attempt to influence public opinion or government policy, or may undertake direct action to attempt to directly enact desired changes themselves.
