      <h1>浆糊的英文说法有mucilage 写信封用 address the envelop</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>I addressed the new envelope and took it up to the counter to send.

<p>写信封地址等用 “address the envelop”。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chinese mucilage does not stick. Not even a little. Whether this is because of deficient mucilage technology or in order to make it possible for the PSB to open envelopes without steaming them, I do not know. It’s tacky, but it doesn’t stick. I noticed a little slot in the machine that looked like it was for swiping the edge of a sealed envelope through. Perhaps, I thought, this heats the mucilage or applies even pressure, or magic postal pixie-dust, or whatever else is necessary to make the goddamn mucilage stick. So I swiped the envelope through it. Stupid, stupid, stupid. This applied another layer of mucilage to the outside of the envelope. I now had an unsealed envelope coated with tacky mucilage and fingers that looked like I had just crammed them up the nose of a three-year old.</p>

<p>我同意。邮局的浆糊跟掺了水似的。就好像饺子馆上的醋都掺了水似的。</p>

<p>难道在邮局也要象在饺子馆一样说类似“给我上不加水的陈醋”才能得到你应该得到的东西？</p>

<p>“给我瓶没掺水的浆糊~”</p>

  <p>Mucilage is a thick gluey substance, often produced by plants. Mucilage is another term for so called exopolysaccharides. These are sugar substances that cover the outside of, for example, unicellular or filamentous green algae and cyanobacteria. Amongst the green algae especially the group Volvocales are known to produce exopolysaccharides at least in a certain part of their life cycle.
