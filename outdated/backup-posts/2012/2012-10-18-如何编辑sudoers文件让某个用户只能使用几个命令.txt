# 如何编辑sudoers文件让某个用户只能使用几个命令

> sudo, restrcited a user to certain commands
> 
> The syntax for the user lines in the sudoers file follows this syntax:
> who host=(accounts) commands
> Broken down, that means:
> who: the account that is having its ability to use sudo privileges modified
> host: the system that the account is able to run these sudo commands on (the sudoers file can be shared across multiple computers, so that’s when this would come into play)
> accounts: what other accounts on the machine the user running sudo can act as
> commands: the commands that the account represented by who can run as sudo
> 
> backupuser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/backuptool
> And that is how I restricted an account’s ability to use one single command as root using sudo without a password.
