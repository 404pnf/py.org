the sound of silence这首歌的历史

> "The Sounds of Silence" is the song that propelled the 1960s folk music duo Simon and Garfunkel to popularity. It was written in February 1964 by Paul Simon in the aftermath of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. Simon conceived of the song as a way of capturing the emotional trauma felt by many Americans.

我从paul simon某次采访中知道上榜的版本音乐是重新配的，这2位根本不知道这回事。后来paul回到美国要上电视节目，上台前还要教给他安排的吉他手怎么弹电声版的这首歌。那人说我就是录音中的吉他手。

> "The main thing about playing the guitar, though, was that I was able to sit by myself and play and dream. And I was always happy doing that. I used to go off in the bathroom, because the bathroom had tiles, so it was a slight echo chamber. I'd turn on the faucet so that water would run — I like that sound, it's very soothing to me — and I'd play. In the dark. 'Hello darkness, my old friend / I've come to talk with you again'."
