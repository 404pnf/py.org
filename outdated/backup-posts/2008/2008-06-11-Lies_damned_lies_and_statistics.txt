Lies, damned lies, and statistics 

> [Lies, damned lies, and statistics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies%2C_damned_lies%2C_and_statistics)
> This well-known saying is part of a phrase attributed to Benjamin Disraeli and popularized in the U.S. by Mark Twain: There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics. The semi-ironic statement refers to the persuasive power of numbers, and succinctly describes how even accurate statistics can be used to bolster inaccurate arguments.
