# 问 dead cat bounce 怎么翻译好

今天读到一个词是说前一段中国股市的。我是没有兴趣，但扫文章的时候发现这个词。我根据上下文猜意思没有完全猜对。也给大家看看。

这个熟语就是 dead cat bounce。对，不应该叫词。应该说是熟语，idiom。

dead cat bounce。死猫也会跳？！

这是谁发明的词啊，这么讨厌。让猫猫死。

我看到这个词的语境是中国股票崩了？第2天涨了一下。过一天又降了很多。过一天又涨了。他说上涨不过是dead cat bounce。原文我一时找不到了。

我理解就是回光返照。但后来觉得是难以抵挡那种颓势。

现在我也不知道合适的翻译。请大家讨论和指教吧。

>A dead cat bounce is a term used in market economics to describe a pattern wherein a sharp rise in the price of a stock follows a spectacular fall, with the connotation that the rise does not indicate improving circumstances. It is derived from the notion that "even a dead cat will bounce if it falls hard enough".

>A 'dead cat bounce' is a rather unpleasant term used to describe a small, short term recovery in a falling stock's price. Why? Well, if a cat was dropped from the top of a tall building it would bounce when it hit the ground - but it wouldn't bounce much and it would still be dead.
