>Nice playing for a 13 year old. The first song she plays is a tune by Joe Satriani. The second song is Crosstown Traffic by Jimi Hendrix

顺便说一句，crosstown traffic有一个jimi的版本是和big band合作 很有意思的 自己找mp3去听吧 那个版本似乎不在他后来的那些精选专辑中

>I'm the guy who taped this gifted girl. Thankfully she does not think she is superior to others or attempts to insult others as Mr/Ms. professional deinterlacing does, maybe Mr/Ms. professional deinterlacing would like to let me tape his/her interlacing skills and allow my viewers the pleasure of experiencing those superior talents?
