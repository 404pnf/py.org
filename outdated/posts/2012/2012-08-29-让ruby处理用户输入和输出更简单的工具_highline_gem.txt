# 让ruby处理用户输入和输出更简单的工具 highline gem

HighLine is about…

Saving time.

Command line interfaces are meant to be easy. So why shouldn’t building them be easy, too? HighLine provides a solid toolset to help you get the job done cleanly so you can focus on the real task at hand, your task.

Clean and intuitive design.

Want to get a taste for how HighLine is used? Take a look at this simple example, which asks a user for a zip code, automatically does validation, and returns the result:

zip = ask("Zip?  ") { |q| q.validate = /\A\d{5}(?:-?\d{4})?\Z/ }
Hassle-free Installation.

Installation is easy via RubyGems. Simply enter the command:

sudo gem install highline
and you’ll be on your way! Of course, manual installation is an option, too.
