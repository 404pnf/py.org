# ruhoh rocks

ruhoh titleize doesn't work well with languages other than English?

       title	     	    	 filename			score
       nouvel année	         nouvel-anne.md			good
       sérieux è_é	   	 srieux-_.md			bad
       안녕하세요	    .md				wrong, in fact there isn't a file .md in _posts
       三只熊		    .md				wrongin fact there isn't a file .md in _posts
       غة يابانية	    .md				wrongin fact there isn't a file .md in _posts
       
My file system can handle all these files.  Jekyll can render all of them correctly.

find . -type f 
./30/غةيابانية/index.html
./31/绿色/index.html
./31/sérieux_è_é/index.html
./31/안녕하세요/index.html
