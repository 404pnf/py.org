有几句quote很有意思

    “Life is what happens to you while you’re busy making other plans”

said John Lennon, a famous murder victim from New York.

I still worry about the The Fraud Police though, “I have no idea what I’m doing, and I totally make shit up as I go along.” is a disturbingly precise summary of how I feel about my work in Varnish.
