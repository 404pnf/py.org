Dowry
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
For other uses, see Trousseau (disambiguation).
A dowry is the money, goods, or estate that a woman brings to the marriage.[1] It contrasts with bride price, which is paid by the groom or his family to the bride's parents, and dower, which is property given to the bride herself by the groom at the time of marriage. The same culture may simultaneously practice both dowry and bride price. Dowry is an ancient custom, and its existence may well predate records of it. Dowries continue to be expected in some parts of the world, mainly South Asia.
