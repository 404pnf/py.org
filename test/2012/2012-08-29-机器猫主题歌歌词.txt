konna koto ii na 
dekitara ii na 
anna yume konna yume ippai aru kedo


this sort of thing is good 
I wish I could do it 
that sort of dream, this sort of dream, I have many of them but

minna minna minna 
kanaete kureru 
fushigina POKKE de kanaete kureru 
sora wo jiyuu ni tobitai na

all of them, all of them, all of them 
he grants my dreams 
he grants my dreams with a mysterious pocket 
I want to fly freely in the sky

(hai! takekoputaa!)

(Here! Bamboo-copter!)

ah ah ah 
I love you very much,

shukudai touban shiken ni otsukai 
anna koto konna koto taihen dakedo

homework, school duties, exams and errands 
because that sort of thing and this sort of thing are awful

minna minna minna 
tasukete kureru 
benrina dougu de tasukete kureru 
omocha no heitai da

all of them, all of them, all of them 
he helps me 
he helps me with a convenient tool 
look! a toy soldier

(sore! tototsugeki!)

I wish I could go 
this country, that island, there is many of them, but

ikasete kureru 
mirai no kikai de kanaete kureru 
sekai ryokou ni ikitai na

all of them, all of them, all of them 
he makes me able to go to them 
he uses a gadget of the future to grant my wish 
I want to go on a world trip

(ufufufu... doko demo DOA!)
