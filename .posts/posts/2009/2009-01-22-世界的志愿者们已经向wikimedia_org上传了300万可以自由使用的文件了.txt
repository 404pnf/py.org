> Wikimedia Commons: Three million files and rising
> The three millionth file
> 
> Wikimedia Commons, the multilingual free-content media repository managed by the Wikimedia Foundation, reached the milestone of three million uploaded files on July 16, 2008, less than a year after it reached two million. This makes Wikimedia Commons the fastest growing large Wikimedia project. The rapid growth reflects the young age of the project, launched just under four years ago in September 2004. Since March 2007, Wikimedia Commons has routinely had over 100,000 files uploaded every single month. It is now not uncommon for tens of thousands of files to be uploaded in a single day.

> Wikimedia Commons is a media file repository making available public domain and freely-licensed educational media content (images, sound and video clips) to all. It acts as a common repository for the various projects of the Wikimedia Foundation, but you do not need to belong to one of those projects to use media hosted here. The repository is created and maintained not by paid-for artists but by volunteers. The scope of Commons is set out on the project scope pages.
