> According to earlier media reports, the TX4 will be put into production in August 2008, and will be on sale by the end of the year. Currently their are 30 British made TX4’s doing the rounds in Beijing as part of the Oylmpics, the large seating capacity of the London cabs are excellent for helping disabled visitors to Beijing get around with ease. The smaller Jettas, and Santana taxis wont allow a wheel chair to roll straight in!

> The Chinese made TX4 reportedly makes use of engines supplied by Mitsubishi, the first model will be a 2.4l, their is reports of a follow up 2.0l model.

我在街上看见这款出租了。黑色的。开始不知道是出租，后来一看也是2元一公里。心想何时能碰上也打一个。今天知道了是为了残疾人奥运会准备的。因为这车后面很宽，可以直接让坐轮椅的人连车带人进去。

好消息是年底就有卖的了。开量出租款出去～～～～我觉得无所谓。大众、现代和富康有的系列的不都是出租个人都用的车型么。

非常喜欢这车后面的宽敞。坐的人腿可以完全伸直，而且可以直接把小行李放在脚前头。

今天知道了它能够直接运轮椅，就更值得考虑了。否则，还需要面包或者大型的suv。

我当时看觉得好是因为我想后面这么宽敞，以后老婆怀孕了上下车又舒服又方便。：）
