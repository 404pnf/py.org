文章中引用的漫画真是厉害。一针见血又非常有趣！

本以为是一篇纯谈经济和体制的文章，再看，看到这段

> The really dark side of it all is the fact that they can control down to the penny, and tax down to the penny, and monitor down to the penny your every digital dollar / penny spend or receipt. That your digital "stuff" as George Carlin would probably call it is not actually **owned** by you when it is digital, that you are allowed access or use of your "stuff" to the extent that they think it is ok for you, how they think it is ok for you, and when they think it is ok for you. That is of course unless you have control over the server and access to root. Do you? Didn't think so.

后面也谈了相关的。

好文。
