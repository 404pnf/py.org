# ruby的array中有sample方法帮你随机选取元素

> sample → obj click to toggle source
> sample(random: rng) → obj
> sample(n) → new_ary
> sample(n, random: rng) → new_ary
> Choose a random element or n random elements from the array. The elements are chosen by using random and unique indices into the array in order to ensure that an element doesn’t repeat itself unless the array already contained duplicate elements. If the array is empty the first form returns nil and the second form returns an empty array.

> If rng is given, it will be used as the random number generator.
