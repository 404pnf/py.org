# DMAA is a natural, could be harmful

> GNC Holdings and Vitamin Shoppe aren't pharmaceutical firms, but a chunk of their future revenue could depend as much on the opinions of scientists as on the views of shoppers perusing their shelves.

> Dimethylamylamine, or DMAA, is a key ingredient in supplements used by weightlifters looking to amp up before working out and dieters trying to curb their appetites. But it has raised health concerns. The Defense Department pulled supplements containing DMAA from military base shelves last year on concerns it played a role in two soldiers' deaths. The Food and Drug Administration in April warned supplement makers and suppliers using DMAA that they hadn't shown that it is safe.

> 
> Some retailers have stopped selling products that contain DMAA, but both GNC and Vitamins Shoppe continue to offer them. GNC points out that it doesn't manufacture private label products that include DMAA, and that the DMAA-containing products it sells "are widely available at other retailer outlets." Vitamin Shoppe didn't respond to requests for comment but has previously said that if the FDA requires it to recall a product it will "promptly comply."
> 
> DMAA use in supplements relies on a 1996 study in the now-defunct Journal of the Guizhou Institute of Technology, which said it found DMAA in a type of geranium. On that basis, supplement makers marketed the ingredient as naturally-occurring.
> 
> But others, including chemists at Australia's National Measurement Institute and at NSF International, a nonprofit organization in Ann Arbor, Mich. that certifies supplements' safety, have failed to find DMAA in geranium. In June, a study in the peer-reviewed Journal of Analytical Toxicology by a University of Mississippi led-team that included researchers at the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency found no DMAA in a variety of geranium samples. On Thursday, a study in the peer-reviewed journal Drug Testing and Analysis led by University of Texas at Arlington chemist Daniel Armstrong similarly described how tests detected no DMAA in eight geranium oil samples from different regions. The limit of detection was 10 parts per billion.
> 
> Absent evidence that DMAA exists in geranium, its time on store shelves could be short, says Marc Ullman, a specialist in FDA law with Ullman, Shapiro & Ullman. "If the substance is not found in nature at all, that's very significant because there's little statutory basis for saying this is a viable dietary ingredient," he says.
