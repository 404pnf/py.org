# october的oct不是表示8的意思么，怎么成了10月了


> 历史上，历法被政治所利用的事情很多，古罗马皇帝为了让以自己名字明明的两个月（July和Augus）更突出，让本来意思是8月的October挪到了10月。

这个说法有趣，也挺对的。因为oct就是8的字根。那么，同样september的sept也是7的字根，等于也后移动了。再仔细一查，后面都跟着动了。这个说法作为故事，完全可以的。历史上究竟怎么回事？

### 最处的罗马历
Roman writers attributed the original Roman calendar to Romulus, the founder of Rome around 753 BC. The Romulus calendar had ten months with the spring equinox in the first month:

Calendar of Romulus
Martius (31 days)
Aprilis (30 days)
Maius (31 days)
Iunius (30 days)
Quintilis [2] (31 days)
Sextilis (30 days)
September (30 days)
October (31 days)
November (30 days)
December (30 days)

The regular calendar year consisted of 304 days, with the winter days after the end of December and the beginning of the following March not being assigned to any month.[3]

The names of the months from the fifth month were based on their position in the calendar: Quintilis comes from Latin quinque meaning five; Sextilis from sex meaning six; September from septem meaning seven; October from octo meaning eight; November from novem meaning nine; and December from decem meaning ten. The first 4 months were named in honour of Roman gods: Martius in honour of Mars; Aprilis, unknown; Maius in honour of Maia; and Iunius in honour of Juno.

看到了？最初罗马日历只有10个月。从quintilis（当时的5月）开始，月份中都有数字字字根。10个月之后的冬天，没有用任何月份命名。

### Calendar of Numa

这一阶段，增加了january和feburary。且重新定了每个月有多少天。增加的2个月份，排在之前10个月的后面。也就是当今的Jan按当时是11月，Feb是12月。这时历法增加到12个月了。

Numa Pompilius, the second of the seven traditional kings of Rome, reformed the calendar of Romulus around 713 BC. The Romans considered odd numbers to be lucky,[4] so Nuna took one day from each of the six months with 30 days, reducing the number of days in the previous 10 months by 6.
He made the undefined winter days which previously numbered 51 days, to which were added the 6 days from the changes to the days in the months, making a total of 57 days. These he made into 2 months, January and February, which he prefixing to the previous 10 months. January was given 29 days while February had the unlucky number of 28 days, suitable for the month of purification. This made a regular year 355 days long in place of the previous 304 days of the Romulus calendar. Of the 11 months with an odd number of days, 4 had 31 days each and 7 had 29 days each:

### 当今使用的日历时期

Julian calendar

Julius Caesar, as Pontifex Maximus, reformed the calendar in 46 BC, which became known as the Julian calendar. The calendar reforms were completed during the reign of his successor Augustus, who renamed Quintilis as Iulius (July) in honour of Julius Caesar in 44 BC and Sextilis as Augustus (August) in honour of Augustus in 8 BC.

这里确实提到了，为了向Caesar和Augustus致敬，改Quintilis为Iulius (July)，改 Sextilis为Augustus (August)。

注意，是改原来含有数字5的字根那个月为7月，原来含有字根6的那个月为8月。所以，并不是从它开始月份整体后移的。
