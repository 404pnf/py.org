# 简短清晰说明xargs的作用；和xarg -0 以及 find -print0 是什么意思

> To better understand this, let's look at something that won't work. Say you wanted to delete all markdown files. You might be tempted to try:
> 
>     find . -iname "*.md" | rm
>  
> The first part does what we expect it to do, it finds all files with a markdown extension. However, piping find's output to rm doesn't do anything other than display the help message for rm. Why is that? Remember, pipe redirects a program's output to another program's input. rm however does not work via standard input. It works via the command-line. In C#, that's the difference between Console.ReadLine() and using the args[] parameter.

>   
>     find . -iname "*.md" | xargs rm

> If you've been following along, you can guess that xargs takes data from the standard input (hence data can be piped to it) and converts that to command-line parameters for whatever program you specify (rm in this case).

另外根据man page：

       --arg-file=file
       -a file
              Read items from file instead of standard  input.   If  you  use
              this  option,  stdin  remains  unchanged when commands are run.
              Otherwise, stdin is redirected from /dev/null.

       --null
       -0     Input items are terminated by a null character  instead  of  by
              whitespace, and the quotes and backslash are not special (every
              character is  taken  literally).   Disables  the  end  of  file
              string,  which is treated like any other argument.  Useful when
              input items might contain white space, quote  marks,  or  back‐
              slashes.   The  GNU find -print0 option produces input suitable
              for this mode.

这里说明那个 -0 (阿拉伯数字0)的意思是，默认xarg根据空格来分割文件名，因此如果前面命令传入的文件名可能是有空格，就会出现错误，这时用 -0 就好了，会忽略空格，反斜杠和引号。同样，要让前面传入的文件名符合要求，可用 gnu find -print0 。
