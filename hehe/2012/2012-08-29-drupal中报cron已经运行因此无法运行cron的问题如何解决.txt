# drupal中报cron已经运行因此无法运行cron的问题如何解决

DELETE FROM variable WHERE name="cron_semaphore";
DELETE FROM variable WHERE name = "cron_last";
This worked for me. I had to clear my drupal cache after running the sql above. Then I ran cron manually and it worked.

如果有drush

drush @site sqlc 然后运行上面两个sql命令。
之后马上 drush @site cc all 清除缓存

再 drush @site cron 就可以了

这是drupal 6。
