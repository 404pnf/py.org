不是劣质中国产催泪弹杀了示威的泰国妇女

因看到消息说泰警方认为示威中胸口被炸伤而死亡的妇女，死亡原因是使用的催泪弹里出现了含有RDX的物质。大部分催泪弹产地是中国，而且在中国的催泪弹中检查出了这种不应该出现在催泪弹中的报摘性物质。我去信给泰国朋友表示我做为一个中国人的歉意和愤怒。

泰国朋友对我表示感谢，说问题不在于谁的产品，在于到底要干什么。

朋友给出最新报道说不是催泪弹致命，而是泰国警察使用了手榴弹，企图隐瞒，且想把责任推卸给劣质产品。

我是感觉好一些。但除非催泪弹中检查出rdx也是假的。否则，这类中国产品迟早还是要酿成悲剧的。

另一位泰国朋友说的更直接一点：

> I am sorry, I just checked e-mail this afternoon, so I hope you have got the fact from [omit name] already she had sent cc. to me. I wish the Prime Minister would responsible for this situation by resignment.
> He never think like you think, it is not Chinese mistake, the police knows that the tear gas from China is danger than tear gas from European countries so they used it to disperse the mob.
> 
> Thank you for your concerned. 

虽然不是中国的错误。但如果这位朋友的话属实，我可不想接近中国产催泪弹。

令一篇消息 Damages from RDX Tear Gas Bomb Alone?

望这位遇难的泰国女士安息。

内的网友对泰国前几天的指控回应非常“聪明”，认为“不可能是中国产品的问题，因为中国出口的催泪弹是不添加RDX的”。说得很幽默。想想真心酸。
