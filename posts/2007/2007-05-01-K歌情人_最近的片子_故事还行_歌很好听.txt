Way Back Into Love 



Way Back Into Love - Hugh Grant & Haley Bennett 

I have been sleeping with a cloud above my bed 
I have been living with a shadow overhead 
I have been lonely for so long 
Trapped in the past, I just can not seem to move on 
I have been hiding all my hopes and dreams away 
Just in case I ever need them again someday 
I have been setting aside time 
To clear a little space in the corners of my mind 
All I want to do is find a way back into love 
I can not make it through without a way back into love 
Oh oh oh 
I have been watching but the stars refuse to shine 
I have been searching but I just do not see the signs 
I know that it is out there 
There is got to be something for my soul somewhere 
I have been looking for someone to shed some light 
Not just somebody just to get me throught the night 
I could use some direction 
And I am open to your suggestions 
All I want to do is find a way back into love 
I can not make it through without a way back into love 
And if I open my heart again 若我再次敞开心房 
I guess I am hoping you will be there for me in the end 
There are moments when I do not know if it is real 
Or if anybody feels the way I feel 
I need inspiration 
Not just another negotiation 
All I want to do is find a way back into love 
I can not make it through without a way back into love 
And if I open my heart to you 
I am hoping you will show me what to do 
And if you help me to start again 
You know that I will be there for you in the end 
你知道最后我会在那里等你 
我活在阴影之下 
乌云伴我共枕 
一直孤单好久 
困在过去，似乎就是无法往前走 

我把所有的希望和梦想藏起来 
只为了有一天可能又需要他们 
我总留些时间 
净化心里的小角落 

我只要重新找到爱的感觉 
若没有爱的感觉我办不到 

我留心观察然而繁星不愿发亮 
我一直搜寻但看不到任何征兆 
我知道它不在那里 
但一定有个为我灵魂而生的东西在某处 

我一直寻找着让我发光的人 
而非只是个陪我过夜的家伙 
我能使用一些指示 
而且我可能是你的暗示 

我只要找到重新爱的感觉 
若没有爱的感觉我办不到 
我想我希望最后你会在那里等我 

有时候我不确定它是不是真的 
或许有人和我心有戚焉 
我需要妙计 
而非又一个妥协 

我只要重新找到爱的感觉 
若没有爱的感觉我办不到 
若我为你打开心房 
希望你会告诉我该怎么做 
若你帮我重新开始
