问 empirical和empirically翻译成什么好

我发现我是根本不查字典了。 还是图省事，问一下大家，这个词中文什么对应比较好。你们查字典也可以：） [define: empirical](http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3A+empirical) > derived from experiment and observation rather than theory; "an empirical basis for an ethical theory"; "empirical laws"; "empirical data"; "an empirical treatment of a disease about which little is known" > empiric: relying on medical quackery; "empiric treatment" > http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn > > Empiricism (greek εμπειρισμ????, from empirical, latin experientia - the experience) is generally regarded as being at the heart of the modern scientific method, that our theories should be based on our observations of the world rather than on intuition or faith; that is, empirical research and a posteriori inductive reasoning rather than purely deductive logic. > http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical
