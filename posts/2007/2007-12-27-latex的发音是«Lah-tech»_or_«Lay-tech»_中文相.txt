## latex的发音是«Lah-tech» or «Lay-tech»；中文相当于“勒太克” lei1 tai4 ke4，当然发那个太的音嘴要扁的一点，不要发出爱的音，更像e。 我一直以为那个x也要发eks的音呢。今天才知道不是这样。 > And in case you were wondering, «LaTeX» is pronounced «Lah-tech» or «Lay-tech», > http://www.latex-project.org/intro.html 这里有更详细的读音和名字来源 > How do you pronounce it? Why that strange typesetting? > > There is a funny traditions of TEX-related packages to have the strangest pronunciation and typesetting possible. TEX was supposed to be brought in from the Greek τεχ, in Latin letters tech. There are a lot of explanations why, but most likely it is because TEX was originally conceived for technical reports, and indeed its foremost ability was the correct and easy typesetting of mathematical formulae, then an extremely expensive, time-consuming and frustrating business. > > The pronunciation is supposed to be as follows: T as you would expect, E as in get, and X as in the German ich. If you do not know what ch sounds like, it is more or less as an hissing cat; the IPA symbol is /ç/. Many people report the different pronunciation of ach (IPA symbol /x/), but I have personally asked some Greeks, and can confirm the first version. You should be aware that a lot of people mispronounce /teks/ or /tek/. > > Last, in LATEX the first LA is pronounced as lay: the idea is that, while raw TEX is difficult, even a layman can use LATEX macros. A less inspiring, but more realistic explanation is that it stems from the surname of Leslie Lamport, the creator of LATEX. Now you know!
