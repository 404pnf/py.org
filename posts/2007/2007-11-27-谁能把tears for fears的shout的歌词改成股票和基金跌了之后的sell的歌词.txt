谁能把tears for fears的shout的歌词改成股票和基金跌了之后的sell的歌词

我不买基金。但有朋友的基金跌了，所有都跌了。圈够钱了，坏人该卷钱走人了。说到这事，我回信说快sell的时候，边打字，脑海里出现了shout这首歌。因此，打下sell, sell, sell it all out。 我觉得有玩家应该改一下这首歌词，让他和卖股票卖基金结合起来。 下面是歌词 tears for fears lyrics shout http://www.google.cn/search?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=tears+for+fears+lyrics+shout 开始以为是def leppard唱的，没搜到，就是想不起是谁唱的，原来t f f 呀。 第一段歌词例子 http://www.lyricsfreak.com/t/tears+for+fears/shout\_20135578.html Shout Chorus Shout Shout Let it aloud These are the things I can do without Come on Im talking to you Come on (repeat) In violent times You shouldnt have to sell your soul In black and white They really really ought to know Those one track minds That took you for a working boy Kiss them goodbye You shouldnt have to jump for joy You shouldnt have to jump for joy
