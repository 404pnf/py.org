> Don't worry about it, that's all done by CRON and its cronjobs, they all run as root by default.

> that's right cron opened all those sessions. anyway the su was opened by user nobody - no cause for alarm.

> when u check ur logs look out for those with ip addr n user name interchage for other user names t with SU. then u will know u r at risk.
