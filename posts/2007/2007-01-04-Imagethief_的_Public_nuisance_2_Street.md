# Imagethief 的 Public nuisance 2 Street market fire drill 和 Mascot for the Beijing Psychedelic Games

> Imagethief : Public nuisance 2: Street market fire drill
> "The corner of Dawang Lu and Jian Wai, near my apartment, has always had a thriving little street market. Tibetan tchatchke sellers, a couple of people selling books out of cardboard boxes, the sock lady, the women's hair accessory man (perhaps he and the sock lady should trade concessions), a rotating cast of fruit sellers, magazine boy, antique dude (he never displays more than two small items, as if he's slowly pilfering some stash someplace) and various vendors of mystery-meat sausage, stuffed breakfast pastries, jianbings, and so on."

> Imagethief : Mascot for the Beijing Psychedelic Games
> "This illustration is topped by the one that now blankets the walls of my local subway station, in which the multi-hued Le Le is shown strolling through a landscape of truly trippy multihued rainbows and starbursts. I'd like to tip my hat to the organizers of the Paralympic Games for acknowledging that even handicapped people can appreciate the effects of recreational drugs, well known for their ability to make people see a lot of colors and be happy happy.

> However, offficially Le Le was selected for the following reasons:
> 
>    1. Showing the rich concept of the Beijing Paralympic Games
>    2. Embodying the harmony between man and nature
>    3. Carrying rich national style and cultural features
>    4. Cows are widely accepted internationally
>    5. Commanding space for future designs and marketing"
