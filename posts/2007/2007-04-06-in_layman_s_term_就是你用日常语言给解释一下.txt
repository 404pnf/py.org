# in layman s term 就是你用日常语言给解释一下

我读到 > Could someone explain in layman terms the difference between the CACHE\_METHOD\_NONE, CACHE\_METHOD\_DATABASE and CACHE\_METHOD\_MEMCACHED settings? A 那么什么是 layman's terms呢 > Putting something in layman's terms means > describing a complex or technical issue in words that the average man on the street—someone without professional training in the subject area—could understand. According to the OED, the term layman originally referred to the laity, persons not in the clergy, and has come to mean a person who is "non-expert...in relation...to a branch of knowledge." The phrase is common among English language speakers. > http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layman's\_terms 顺便问一下中文更好的翻译有什么？
