# pedagogy和warrant 经济上 是什么意思

lyon和我商量几个翻译，正好说到了2个平常基本不用业第一个忘了拼写第二个我忘了什么意思的词。 中文是什么意思请大家留言说说吧。 > > define: pedagogy > http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3A+pedagogy > > teaching method: the principles and methods of instruction > teaching: the profession of a teacher; "he prepared for teaching while still in college"; "pedagogy is recognized as an important profession" > education: the activities of educating or instructing; activities that impart knowledge or skill; "he received no formal education"; "our instruction was carefully programmed"; "good classroom teaching is seldom rewarded" > http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn > > Pedagogy is the art or science of teaching.
