> Dear employees,

> Due to the current financial situation caused by theslowdown of economy, Management has decided to implement a scheme toput workers of 40 years of age and above on early retirement. Thisschemewill be known as RAPE (Retire Aged People Early).
> 
> Persons selected to be RAPED can apply to management to be eligiblefor the SHAFT scheme (Special Help After Forced Termination). Persons who have been RAPED and SHAFTED will be reviewed under the SCREW programme(Scheme Covering Retired Early Workers). A person may be RAPED once, SHAFTED twic eand SCREWED as many times as Management deems appropriate.
> 
> Persons who have been RAPED can only get AIDS (Additional Income for Dependants & Spouse) or HERPES (Half Earnings for Retired PersonnelEarly Severance). Obviously persons who have AIDS or HERPES will not be SHAFTED or SCREWED any further by Management.
> 
> Persons who are not RAPED and are staying on will receive as much SHIT (Special High Intensity Training) as possible. Management hasalwaysprideditself on the amount of SHIT it gives employees. Should you feel thatyoudo not receive enough SHIT, please bring to the attention of your Supervisor. Theyhavebeen trained to give you all the SHIT you can handle.
