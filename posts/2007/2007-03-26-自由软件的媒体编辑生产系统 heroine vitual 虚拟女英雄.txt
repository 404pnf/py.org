自由软件的媒体编辑生产系统 heroine vitual 虚拟女英雄

最近准备学习和自己死磕一下视频编辑 windows/apple下的东西这里就不多说了。只是在跟别人学习的时候在别人机器上用。 严肃的工作我日后还是会在gnu/linux这个自由软件系统下用自由软件工具完成。 音频简单编辑有了audacity，视频有kino等。今天发现了一套看起来很不错的。准备尝试。 项目名称是：heroine vitual 虚拟女英雄 http://heroinewarrior.com/index.php3 我这个翻译不知道着不着调。大家一起想想更好的翻译。 这是一个自由软件项目，专门给我等无业、缺钱，喜欢大型软件和女英雄但没什么现金的人。哈哈。 ![](http://heroinewarrior.com/heroine\_logo8.jpg) > http://heroinewarrior.com/heroinevirtual.php3 > Heroine Virtual has produced content creation software for power users since 1996. It all started with one guy sitting behind an early SGI box and being amazed at what something as dull and boring as a UNIX derivative could do. We wanted to take that razzle dazzle moving picture capability to the Linux box. > > Heroine Virtual believes in getting amazing things out of one of the most efficient operating systems available. The last seven years have seen a steady increase in size and power of our stuff but it still needs nothing more than a basic Linux box. > > Heroine Virtual is not run by heroines but by heroine worshippers: unemployed, financially challenged guys like you, all with a love of big software and heroines but no cash. > > One day we'll be converting simple photographs into complete motion pictures in a matter of minutes. In the mean time, you won't find much convenience or stylishness in our tools but hopefully you'll be able to tweek multimedia in ways you never thought of before. > > ABOUT THE HEROINE LOGO > > The green heroine was not drawn by us. Long ago, she appeared on a heroine engineer web page at the UF of L. She has long since disappeared. Since then, we added a film segment, new shadows, and made her pick up a steel beam.
