# 单词 gobbledygook


>I hate unix & Perl, but given that i'm a unix admin and a god-damn-good Perl programer for years, i secretly find it nice to be able to exercise my expertise to my advantage under OS X. All those gobbledygook ls cd vi sed awk perl mysql sh csh tcsh ksh make | || && < & excrement and friends are now under the control of my fingers of my home OS. All the utterly-stupid but never-the-less-already-there unix programs are now available for Mac if i wanted it. Even though i disapprove, at least i should be thankful that Mac OS X, in certain aspect, can be thought of and used like a unix.
