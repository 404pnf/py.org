I have a special feeling for the New Year Celebration in Bangkok, because I spent the night with my Thai friends in 2001. Watched the fireworks, the crowded square in front of huge mall, taking subways and everything. I remember that.

I didn't write much about my memory of new year celebration in bangkok, not in the mood. I will write something in comment in the future.
