# drupal Links and IMG

> Yes, you can link between pages in Drupal. It's the same as not having Drupal, except the name may be weird if you're not using the Path module (URL Aliasing). > > The biggest mistake people make is not knowing that there needs to be a leading slash ("/"). Omitting this will probably cause a "404:Page not found" error and, depending on which browser you're using, additional problems, like being logged out. > > For example, if your home page on a site is node #4, a link to it would look like this: [Home](/node/4), but with URL aliasing turned on, you can also code it like this: [Home](/home) > > A picture could be embedded with this tag: ![](/sites/default/files/pictures/WDP.jpg) > http://drupal.org/book/export/html/124931 > > http://drupal.org/handbook/site-recipes
