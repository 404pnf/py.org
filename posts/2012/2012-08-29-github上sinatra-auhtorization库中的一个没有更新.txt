# github上sinatra-auhtorization库中的一个没有更新造成的错误

这个gem的标准地址在 
http://rubygems.org/gems/sinatra-authorization

       # From you app, call set :authorization_realm, "my app" to set this
          # or define a #authorization_realm method in your helpers block.
          def authorization_realm
            Sinatra::Default.authorization_realm
          end
      https://github.com/integrity/sinatra-authorization/blob/master/lib/sinatra/authorization.rb
> It's solves the problem because Sinatra doesn't have Default class anymore. And if you want to access some settings defined with :set you should use settings. for this.
