## interpunct就是分割英文人名的那个标点的拼写

> An interpunct ( · ), also called an interpoint,[1] is a punctuation mark consisting of a dot used for interword separation in ancient Latin script and in some modern languages as a stand-alone sign inside a word. It is present in Unicode as code point U+00B7 · middle dot (HTML: &#183; &middot;).
> 
> The dot is vertically centered, e.g. "DONA·EIS·REQVIEM", and is therefore also called a middle dot or centered dot (Commonwealth: centred dot). In addition to the round dot form, inscriptions sometimes use a small equilateral triangle for the interpunct, pointing either up or down. Such triangles can be found on inscriptions on buildings in the twentieth century. Ancient Greek, by contrast, had not developed interpuncts; all the letters ran together. The use of spaces for word separation did not appear until much later, some time between 600 and 800 AD.

## no matter what they take from me, they can't take my dignity

from the song The Greatest Love of All

整个歌词都很美。

      "Greatest Love Of All"
      
      I believe the children are our future
      Teach them well and let them lead the way
      Show them all the beauty they possess inside
      Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
      Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
      
      Everybody's searching for a hero
      People need someone to look up to
      I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
      A lonely place to be
      So I learned to depend on me
      
      [Chorus:]
      I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadows
      If I fail, if I succeed
      At least I'll live as I believe
      No matter what they take from me
      They can't take away my dignity
      Because the greatest love of all
      Is happening to me
      I found the greatest love of all
      Inside of me
      The greatest love of all
      Is easy to achieve
      Learning to love yourself
      It is the greatest love of all
      
      I believe the children are our future
      Teach them well and let them lead the way
      Show them all the beauty they possess inside
      Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
      Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
      
      [Chorus]
      
      And if, by chance, that special place
      That you've been dreaming of
      Leads you to a lonely place
      Find your strength in love

## 没有必要把white house翻译成白屋
我开始觉得美国国务院希望把白宫翻译成白屋有些道理，它给出的理由是 white house 是个 house 不是palace，而且 “宫” 容易让人联想到贵族和王室，美国是共和国没有那些东西。

后来我爸说宫不是必须和皇室相关，漂亮的大房子也可以叫宫，而且距离少年宫。对啊。一下就明白了。虽然少年宫翻译成 Children's Palace，但使用中文的人怎么会把他和皇室相连呢。

> At 101 years old, renowned University of Chicago Law School economist Ronald H. Coase has never stopped generating new ideas or giving his witty, confident take on past intellectual skirmishes.
> 
> [snip] ...
> 
> How China Became Capitalist, Coase’s newest academic work, traces the market transformation China has experienced over the past 35 years. The book argues that the changes came not from deliberate actions taken by Chinese leadership, as often claimed by Beijing, but from “marginal revolutions.”
> 
> “China became capitalist while it was trying to modernize socialism,” write Coase and Wang. “The story of China is the quintessence of what Adam Ferguson called ‘the products of human action but not human design.’ A Chinese proverb puts it more poetically: ‘The flowers planted on purpose do not blossom; the willows no one cared for have grown into big shade trees.’”
> 
> Coase already has set his sights on his next project, one that speaks to the intuitive side of his approach to economics. He plans to launch a journal entitled Man and the Economy, for which he will serve as founding editor.
> 
> “We are going to do again for economics what I did with law & economics: We are going to establish a subject,” Coase says. “Economics has become a theory and math-driven subject, and I believe the approach should be empirical. You study the system as it is, understand why it works the way it does, and consider what changes could be made in order to improve the system.”
> 
> Coase says his main scholarly talent has been to identify solutions that were in plain sight.
> 
> “I’ve never done anything that wasn’t obvious, and I didn’t know why other people didn’t do it,” he says. “I’ve never thought the things I did were so extraordinary.”

## baidu旗下的ting音乐平台有些艺人介绍是机器翻译的

> Ok Go是来自芝加哥的一个摇滚乐队,现在居住在洛杉矶。乐队成员有Kulash （牵头的嗓音和吉他） ,Nordwind （低音吉他和支持声） ,丹科诺普卡（鼓和打击乐）和安迪罗斯（键盘,吉他和支持声） ,加入他们在2005年更换邓肯的安迪。 1998年,发行了两个专辑。乐队其意义不同寻常是衣服和他们精力充沛的音乐,尤其是他们的两个最成功的单曲“百万途径”和“在这里不用再” 。后者获得了格莱美奖“最佳短篇音乐录影带”是在2007年。
<http://ting.baidu.com/artist/219444/introduction>

上面的中文能看懂但很不通顺且又不少机器或者翻译人员根本不在乎翻译结果而产生的错误。如：

	牵头的嗓音 leanding voice
	支持声	   supporting voice

不通顺的地方倒是不影响理解就是读着费劲。

我觉得机器翻译后就猜想原文是否是维基百科。查了一下，和我猜想差不多吧。

> OK Go is an American alternative rock band originally from Chicago, Illinois, but now residing in Los Angeles, California. The band is composed of Damian Kulash (lead vocals, guitar and car), Tim Nordwind (bass guitar and vocals), Dan Konopka (drums and percussion) and Andy Ross (guitar, keyboards and vocals), who joined them in 2005, replacing Andy Duncan. They are perhaps best known for their often elaborate and quirky music videos.
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK_Go>

维基百科中文该乐队条目：

> OK Go摇滚乐队最初在美国伊利诺伊州芝加哥组建，目前在洛杉矶。乐队有Damian Kulash司职主唱和吉它，Tim Nordwind司职(電貝斯 和 和声), Dan Konopka(鼓 和 打击乐器) 和 Andy Ross(主音吉它, 键盘和和声), 他在2005年取代了Andy Duncan。OK Go乐队以他们鲜明有特色的音乐视频出名。在2007年，OK Go乐队的视频Here It Goes Again赢得葛萊美獎的最佳短片音乐录音带
<http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK_Go>

这个就通顺多了。

### baidu没有直接使用wikiepdia中文条目对于baidu来说是个小小的进步

不再像biadu百科开始那样抄过来东西然后说是自己的。就是很有中国企业民族风的做法。该行为受到了知情人在文字和道义上的谴责，也有维基百科热心人员（两个台湾人，一男一女）在欧洲技术展会上还是sbsw上争取到机会把此事公开并向百度海外潜在投资人投诉，希望他们不要投资这家公司，投了的也卖了算了。

### 现在这个机器翻译难道不是wikepdia英文的衍生作品么

我觉得非常像。当然也可以说介绍一个乐队简介就那些信息，大家写的差不多。因此虽然百度的翻译很像是从wikipedia英文条目翻译过来，但其实是从与该条目写的很相似的其它来源翻译的。这是合理的。虽然我们不知道是什么来源。作为一个“xxxx的”公司，应该会告诉大家的。除非它是“xxxx的”公司。

可以肯定的是，这里明显是翻译，如果baidu企图说ting音乐平台的文字版权归属baidu的话，那么请问

1、乐队和艺人介绍的原文版权持有人是否授权给你了
2、如果原文是维基百科，那么你的中文衍生是否也应该在gfdl下发布呢

如果baidu不准备声明对该平台上的文字拥有版权，或说其拥有无线可能的使用权因为这些文字是网友自行上传编辑的，那它就继续最绚民族风吧。

我看baidu目前的做法是先都抓过来自动翻译，然后如果某艺人比较热门，安排人工去完善翻译或者重写。

### baidu没有直接或间接使用wikipedia中文条目对中文音乐社区来说是个退步

其实ting平台的特点是它歌曲挺全，浏览起来也很方便，速度还快。这些都和艺人介绍文字没有关系。如果艺人介绍文字更好，会让平台更有价值但永远不会用户使用目的，

如果百度直接使用维基百科内容并允许其会员编辑改进，那么这些改进又可以反馈回维基百科。中文社区的在音乐方面的艺人介绍上会有一定提高。假设参与编辑的会员都是爱好音乐且愿意为他们喜爱的艺人写简介，而不是廉价雇佣的实习生。毕竟这是个不错的音乐平台。应该能吸引些喜欢音乐的人。比如我。我是否参与，还看在哪里参与效果更好。

### 合作一下很有搞头的
虽然有些人不屑于和有些人合作。因为有些人没有真诚合作过。

真诚点，合作一下很有搞头的。



## casio在1974年时候才开始生产手表；G-shock是1983年推出的产品
> The Casio Story
> With the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.
> 
> [eclips....]
> 
> In 1983, Casio launched the shock-resistant G-SHOCK watch. This product shattered the notion that a watch is a fragile piece of jewelry that needs to be handled with care, and was the result of Casio engineers taking on the challenge of creating the world’s toughest watch. Using a triple-protection design for the parts, module, and case, the G-SHOCK offered a radical new type of watch that was unaffected by strong impacts or shaking. Its practicality was immediately recognized, and its unique look, which embodied its functionality, became wildly popular, resulting in explosive sales in the early 1990s. The G-SHOCK soon adopted various new sensors, solar-powered radio-controlled technology (described below), and new materials for even better durability. By always employing the latest technology, and continuing to transcend conventional thinking about the watch, the G-SHOCK brand has become Casio’s flagship timepiece product.

## comming of age 是 成年礼

>Coming of age is a young person's transition from childhood to adulthood. The age at which this transition takes place varies in society, as does the nature of the transition.[1] It can be a simple legal convention or can be part of a ritual, as practiced by many societies. In the past, and in some societies today, such a change are associated with the age of sexual maturity (Early-Adolescence); in others, it is associated with an age of religious responsibility. Particularly in western societies, modern legal conventions which stipulate points in late adolescence or early adulthood (most commonly 16-21 when adolescents are generally no longer considered minors and are granted the full rights of an adult) are the focus of the transition. In either case, many cultures retain ceremonies to confirm the coming of age, and significant benefits come with the change. (See also rite of passage.)
>Coming of age is often a topic of fiction. In literature, a novel which deals with coming of age is called a bildungsroman. Similar stories told in film are called coming-of-age films.
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_of_age>

>成年礼，是指人类为了庆祝其成员中长大成人者而举行之礼俗仪式，有订在满二十岁时举办者，如冠礼（女生则是在满十五岁的时候举办，名曰笄礼）；也有定在满十六岁时举办者，如日本人的元服礼，潮州人的出花园以及台湾人的做十六岁

## My suggestions in the back of a napkin.
我根据上下文猜是表示没有经过深思熟虑，快速回答。

网上搜到的解释

> Definition of 'Back Of The Napkin Business Model'
> A slang term that refers to the representation of the basic components of a business model excluding any fine details. It incorporates only the core ideas and success factors of the business. The name comes from the notion that a quick outline of a business can be easily sketched on the back of a napkin to sufficiently demonstrate its fundamental concepts.  
> 	
> Investopedia explains 'Back Of The Napkin Business Model'
> The slang term comes from a hypothetical scenario in which an entrepreneur pitches an idea to a potential investor over coffee, dinner or a drink. The entrepreneur quickly sketches the business model on the back of a napkin to demonstrate the feasibility of the business. 
> 
> This type of business model should probably only be used as part of the initial stages of planning. A final business model should be drafted for clarity and color, including complete details on all operations as well as the short-term and long-term visions of the business. Without a clear understanding of how a business will operate and bring in sustainable revenues, the probability of building a successful company is low.

## october的oct不是表示8的意思么，怎么成了10月了


> 历史上，历法被政治所利用的事情很多，古罗马皇帝为了让以自己名字明明的两个月（July和Augus）更突出，让本来意思是8月的October挪到了10月。
>
> 《松本行弘的程序世界》 p311

这个说法有趣，也挺对的。因为oct就是8的字根。那么，同样september的sept也是7的字根，等于也后移动了。再仔细一查，后面都跟着动了。这个说法作为故事，完全可以的。历史上究竟怎么回事？

### 罗马历

搜索 rome calender july august october


#### 最处的罗马历
Roman writers attributed the original Roman calendar to Romulus, the founder of Rome around 753 BC. The Romulus calendar had ten months with the spring equinox in the first month:

Calendar of Romulus
Martius (31 days)
Aprilis (30 days)
Maius (31 days)
Iunius (30 days)
Quintilis [2] (31 days)
Sextilis (30 days)
September (30 days)
October (31 days)
November (30 days)
December (30 days)

The regular calendar year consisted of 304 days, with the winter days after the end of December and the beginning of the following March not being assigned to any month.[3]

The names of the months from the fifth month were based on their position in the calendar: Quintilis comes from Latin quinque meaning five; Sextilis from sex meaning six; September from septem meaning seven; October from octo meaning eight; November from novem meaning nine; and December from decem meaning ten. The first 4 months were named in honour of Roman gods: Martius in honour of Mars; Aprilis, unknown; Maius in honour of Maia; and Iunius in honour of Juno.

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_calendar>

看到了？最初罗马日历只有10个月。从quintilis（当时的5月）开始，月份中都有数字字字根。10个月之后的冬天，没有用任何月份命名。

#### Calendar of Numa

这一阶段，增加了january和feburary。且重新定了每个月有多少天。增加的2个月份，排在之前10个月的后面。也就是当今的Jan按当时是11月，Feb是12月。这时历法增加到12个月了。

Numa Pompilius, the second of the seven traditional kings of Rome, reformed the calendar of Romulus around 713 BC. The Romans considered odd numbers to be lucky,[4] so Nuna took one day from each of the six months with 30 days, reducing the number of days in the previous 10 months by 6.
He made the undefined winter days which previously numbered 51 days, to which were added the 6 days from the changes to the days in the months, making a total of 57 days. These he made into 2 months, January and February, which he prefixing to the previous 10 months. January was given 29 days while February had the unlucky number of 28 days, suitable for the month of purification. This made a regular year 355 days long in place of the previous 304 days of the Romulus calendar. Of the 11 months with an odd number of days, 4 had 31 days each and 7 had 29 days each:

#### 当今使用的日历时期

Julian calendar

Julius Caesar, as Pontifex Maximus, reformed the calendar in 46 BC, which became known as the Julian calendar. The calendar reforms were completed during the reign of his successor Augustus, who renamed Quintilis as Iulius (July) in honour of Julius Caesar in 44 BC and Sextilis as Augustus (August) in honour of Augustus in 8 BC.

这里确实提到了，为了向Caesar和Augustus致敬，改Quintilis为Iulius (July)，改 Sextilis为Augustus (August)。

注意，是改原来含有数字5的字根那个月为7月，原来含有字根6的那个月为8月。所以，并不是从它开始月份整体后移的。

> 赤陶质地的哈奴曼像
> 哈奴曼（हनुमत्；Hanuman），印度史詩《羅摩衍那》的神猴，擁有四張臉和八支手，解救阿逾陀國王子羅摩之妻悉多，與羅剎惡魔羅波那大戰。
> 
> 羅摩是大神毗濕奴化身。羅摩之妻悉多非常美麗，被楞伽城十頭魔王羅波那用計劫走。羅摩在尋妻途中助猴王須羯哩婆奪得王位。猴王派手下大將哈努曼，隨羅摩去尋妻。哈奴曼勇敢機敏，能騰雲駕霧，火燒楞伽宮，盜仙草，終於幫助羅摩征服了強敵，救出悉多。
> 
> 胡適認為《西遊記》的美猴王孫悟空原型就是取自哈奴曼，他說：“我總疑心這個神通廣大的猴子不是國貨，乃是一件從印度進口的。也許連無支祁的神話也是受了印度影響而倣造的。”又說，「我依著鋼和泰博士的指引，在印度最古的記事詩《拉麻傳》裡尋得一個哈奴曼，大概可以算是齊天大聖的背影了」[1]。隨著印度佛教東傳中國，《羅摩衍那》記載的「楞伽城大戰」中大鬧無憂園的情節，就被改編成《西游记》中孫悟空大闹天宫的故事。陳寅恪與季羨林[2]皆同意此說法。吳曉鈴在《〈西遊記〉和〈羅摩延書〉》一文對孫悟空受哈努曼影響說提出異議。

英文： <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanuman>

> Hanuman was mischievous in his childhood, and sometimes teased the meditating sages in the forests by snatching their personal belongings and by disturbing their well-arranged articles of worship. Finding his antics unbearable, but realizing that Hanuman was but a child, (albeit invincible), the sages placed a mild curse on him by which he became unable to remember his own ability unless reminded by another person. It is hypothesised that without this curse, the entire course of the Ramayana war might have been different, for he demonstrated phenomenal abilities during the war. The curse is highlighted in Kishkindha Kanda and Sundara Kanda when Jambavantha reminds Hanuman of his abilities and encourages him to go and find Sita.[4] The specific verse that is recited by Jambavantha is:
> You are as powerful as the wind;
> You are intelligent, illustrious & an inventor.
> There is nothing in this world that’s too difficult for you;
> Whenever stuck, you are the one who can help.
> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanuman
> 
> In the Hindu epic the Ramayana we read the tale of Rama, an incarnation of the god Vishnu (the Preserver). Rama is a warrior and king, and was married to the lovely Sita. However, the evil demon king Ravana kidnapped Sita, and thus the plot of the Ramayana develops - Rama must rescue his beloved wife. He begins the search, but is unable to locate her. He does, however, come upon a monkey who prostrates himself before Rama and recognizes him as lord of the universe. This is the monkey Hanuman. He joins Rama in his search, and after leaping across the sea he finds Sita in Lanka, the kingdom of Ravana. While Rama makes his way there, Hanuman lets Sita know that he is a messenger of Rama and helps to console her. Ravana learns of Hanuman's presence on the island and sends his son to capture him. The demon king lights Hanuman's tail on fire as punishment, but the nimble Hanuman leaps from rooftop to rooftop, using his tail to burn down many buildings and kill many demons. Rama arrives, rescues Sita and destroys Ravana, and the three reunite.

## 嫁妆 聘礼等 dowary bride price dower

> Dowry
> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
> For other uses, see Trousseau (disambiguation).
> A dowry is the money, goods, or estate that a woman brings to the marriage.[1] It contrasts with bride price, which is paid by the groom or his family to the bride's parents, and dower, which is property given to the bride herself by the groom at the time of marriage. The same culture may simultaneously practice both dowry and bride price. Dowry is an ancient custom, and its existence may well predate records of it. Dowries continue to be expected in some parts of the world, mainly South Asia.

Iron and Silk [Kindle Edition]
Mark Salzman (Author)

"Red Dust" stands out for its unflinching realism and its intimacy with everyday life in China, just as Mark Salzman's "Iron and Silk" (1986) stands out for its sense of humor, Simon Winchester's "The River at the Centre of the World" (1996) for its knowledge and entertaining anecdotes, and Peter Hessler's "River Town" (2001) for its lyrical descriptions of the landscape and its endearing sympathy with the Chinese people.
