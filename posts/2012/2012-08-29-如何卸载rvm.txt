# 如何卸载rvm

> There's a simple command built-in that will pull it:
> 
> rvm implode
> This will remove the rvm/ directory and all the rubies built within it. In order to remove the final trace of rvm, you need to remove the rvm gem, too:
> 
> gem uninstall rvm
> If you've made modifications to your PATH you might want to pull those, too. Check your .bashrc, .profile and .bash_profile files, among other things.
> 
> You may also have an /etc/rvmrc file, or one in your home directory ~/.rvmrc that may need to be removed as well.
