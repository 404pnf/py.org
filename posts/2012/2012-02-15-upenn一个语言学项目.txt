> The Penn Treebank Project
> 
> The Penn Treebank Project annotates naturally-occuring text for linguistic structure. Most notably, we produce skeletal parses showing rough syntactic and semantic information -- a bank of linguistic trees. We also annotate text with part-of-speech tags, and for the Switchboard corpus of telephone conversations, dysfluency annotation. We are located in the LINC Laboratory of the Computer and Information Science Department at the University of Pennsylvania. 
> All data produced by the Treebank is released through the Linguistic Data Consortium. 
> Descriptions and samples of annotated corpora:
> 
> Wall Street Journal | The Brown Corpus | Switchboard | ATIS
> On-line tgrep searches are now possible for those with LDC Online access.
