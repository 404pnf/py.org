# latex math to html png inline image

<https://github.com/justinvh/Markdown-LaTeX>

1. read the README. read the README again

1. install python markdown

      sudo pip install markdown

1. download the markdown-latex script and put it into, in my case, 

      ~/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/markdown/extensions

1. put the latext.py file  directly under extensions folder

1. install depnedencies:

      sudo apt-get install dvipng latex

1. if you used to enclose latex math code in html code, remove the code tag, 

   that is you don't need to ` \[ x^2 + y^2 = c^2 \]`.  This is for markdown with mathjax

   we are preprocessing all math equation to inline png, so refer to the README and use  $math goes here$ syntax.
   
1. inline style math use $math equation$, for display style (bigger and extra) use $\displaystyle math equation$

1. covnver markdown to html use markdown_py, NOTE: NOT the /usr/bin/markdown

     markdown_py -x latex somefile.markdown > somefile.html
	 
1. open the html

1. OH MY GOD

## now all pngs have transparent background

Because I need them to be transparent and made an suggestion to the author and he implemented it rigth away!  Sweet!
