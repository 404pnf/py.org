>> 5.times {puts "guess what?"} guess what? guess what? guess what? guess what? guess what? => 5 >> 10.times {|number| puts number} 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 => 10 >> 1.upto(3) {|number| puts "I can count to #{number}!"} I can count to 1! I can count to 2! I can count to 3! => 1 >> 10.downto(1) {|number| puts number} 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 => 10 >> puts "Blast-off!" Blast-off! => nil >> 5.step(50, 5) {|x| puts "This is the " + x.to\_s + "th time I warn ya!" } This is the 5th time I warn ya! This is the 10th time I warn ya! This is the 15th time I warn ya! This is the 20th time I warn ya! This is the 25th time I warn ya! This is the 30th time I warn ya! This is the 35th time I warn ya! This is the 40th time I warn ya! This is the 45th time I warn ya!
