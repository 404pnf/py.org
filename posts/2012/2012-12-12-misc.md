其著作。

他是仓颉输入法的发明人。拆分解释汉字的文章挺好看。

我是看到天涯上一篇漫画讲解易经的人（http://www.tianya200.com/99134_2.html）推荐他的《易理探微[pdf]》继而由douban上他的小组找到了他网站地址。书还都提供在线阅读和下载。很好！


## 会duanju就是好啊
我是：
中国吉他手排名第三--------倒数
刘林，李延亮，跟我的差距很大
他们都不如我------不如我弹得烂
我弹琴的时候，很多FANS都很激动------想打人
当我结束一曲深情演绎的时候，所有听众都非常开心
我出过很多张吉他唱片，有8个录音师吐血----其中5个住院，2个需要ICU特别看护----7家唱片公司倒闭
我花10000元，租最好的录音棚录制我的名曲
最后当我离开的时候，口袋里有20000元，热情的制作人和录音师们实在是让我无法抗拒，他们说：只要你不来，我们按月给钱给你

## 所谓的“代书费”，是中介巧立名目，网签根本没有这个费用！

> 据中介说，买房子有个费用叫“代书费”，是北京建委收的，收费的缘由是要求网签，而网签是由建委“代书”的，故要收这一笔。问题是，这笔费用不是常量，而是房价×0.5%，也是一笔不小的银子。我没忍住又好事了一把，搜了一下所谓的“代书费”，原来又是中介巧立名目。实际是“10元工本费和80元手续费”。

## DMAA is a natural, could be harmful

> GNC Holdings and Vitamin Shoppe aren't pharmaceutical firms, but a chunk of their future revenue could depend as much on the opinions of scientists as on the views of shoppers perusing their shelves.
> 
> Dimethylamylamine, or DMAA, is a key ingredient in supplements used by weightlifters looking to amp up before working out and dieters trying to curb their appetites. But it has raised health concerns. The Defense Department pulled supplements containing DMAA from military base shelves last year on concerns it played a role in two soldiers' deaths. The Food and Drug Administration in April warned supplement makers and suppliers using DMAA that they hadn't shown that it is safe.
> 
> 
> Some retailers have stopped selling products that contain DMAA, but both GNC and Vitamins Shoppe continue to offer them. GNC points out that it doesn't manufacture private label products that include DMAA, and that the DMAA-containing products it sells "are widely available at other retailer outlets." Vitamin Shoppe didn't respond to requests for comment but has previously said that if the FDA requires it to recall a product it will "promptly comply."
> 
> DMAA use in supplements relies on a 1996 study in the now-defunct Journal of the Guizhou Institute of Technology, which said it found DMAA in a type of geranium. On that basis, supplement makers marketed the ingredient as naturally-occurring.
> 
> But others, including chemists at Australia's National Measurement Institute and at NSF International, a nonprofit organization in Ann Arbor, Mich. that certifies supplements' safety, have failed to find DMAA in geranium. In June, a study in the peer-reviewed Journal of Analytical Toxicology by a University of Mississippi led-team that included researchers at the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency found no DMAA in a variety of geranium samples. On Thursday, a study in the peer-reviewed journal Drug Testing and Analysis led by University of Texas at Arlington chemist Daniel Armstrong similarly described how tests detected no DMAA in eight geranium oil samples from different regions. The limit of detection was 10 parts per billion.
> 
> Absent evidence that DMAA exists in geranium, its time on store shelves could be short, says Marc Ullman, a specialist in FDA law with Ullman, Shapiro & Ullman. "If the substance is not found in nature at all, that's very significant because there's little statutory basis for saying this is a viable dietary ingredient," he says.
> 
> Some manufacturers stopped making supplements containing DMAA after the FDA's warning,

英国于1752年9月从尤利乌斯旧历切换到格里高利新历。这称为改历。

在gnu/linux中可以通过 cal 命令查看。

          $ cal 9 1752 
          September 1752

从9月2日直接跳到14日了！

这个例子是从《松本行弘的程序世界》这本书上看到的，p305。好书！
