# 转abc notation记录的谱到lilypond支持的格式
ABC tune grabber/converter
Usage
Since I don't always want to convert a tune to banjo tabs (some tunes are better on the concertina), a flag (-b) needs to be included with the arguments to specify that the tune should be converted to banjo tabs. Similarly, including the -l flag with compile the final lilypond file into a pdf of sheet music or tabs.
For example: The tune Rakes of Mallow is found at http://www.thesession.org/tunes/display/85 and to convert the tune to banjo tabs and compile to a PDF the following command would be used.
./sessioncovert.rb -bl http://www.thesession.org/tunes/display/85
