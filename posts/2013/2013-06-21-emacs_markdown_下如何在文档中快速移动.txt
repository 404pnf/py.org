##  Outline Navigation:
;;
;;     Navigation between headings is possible using `outline-mode'.
;;     Use `C-M-n` and `C-M-p` to move between the next and previous
;;     visible headings.  Similarly, `C-M-f` and `C-M-b` move to the
;;     next and previous visible headings at the same level as the one
;;     at the point.  Finally, `C-M-u` will move up to a lower-level
;;     (more inclusive) visible heading.## shift to cycle; don't work for me

这个以前是可以用的，也许是因为我现在用emacs-nox的原因。我知道可用因为这个功能当年是我提议给作者然后作者实现了的。现在我用不上啊。 ：（
;; markdown-mode supports outline-minor-mode as well as org-mode-style
;; visibility cycling for atx- or hash-style headers.  There are two
;; types of visibility cycling: Pressing `S-TAB` cycles globally between
;; the table of contents view (headers only), outline view (top-level
;; headers only), and the full document view.  Pressing `TAB` while the
;; point is at a header will cycle through levels of visibility for the
;; subtree: completely folded, visible children, and fully visible.
;; Note that mixing hash and underline style headers will give undesired
;; results.
