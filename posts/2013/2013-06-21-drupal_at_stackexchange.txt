> How to solve some problems with Drupal after upgrade to PHP 5.4
> 
> I’ve found several interesting issue after upgrading PHP 5.3 to PHP 5.4 on Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 sites.
> 
> The first biggest problem was that Drupal was displaying Access denied message on all web pages. It was not possible to login to system. Even http://localhost/?q=admin didn’t work.
> 
> I had to create temporary session. It is quite easy when using Drush:
> 
> drush user-login
> Drush displayed one time session for admin. This solved the problem with admin login.
> 
> The other issue was that there was Access denied message on every page. There were also other very useful messages flooding each page:
> 
> Notice: Undefined index: access in function _menu_link_translate() …
> 
> I spent some time searching for any hint how to resolve this weird behavior. It was necessary to delete all Drupal’s caches.
> 
> Configuration -> Development -> Performance -> Delete cache
> 
> After this clean up Drupal was working correctly.
> 
> Then I checked one older Drupal 6 site and there was nice big red warning:
> 
> Warning: strtotime() [function.strtotime]: It is not safe to rely on the system’s timezone settings. You are *required* to use the date.timezone setting or the date_default_timezone_set() function. In case you used any of those methods and you are still getting this warning, you most likely misspelled the timezone identifier.
> 
> The problem was that there was no default timezone in php.ini. It was sufficient to add timezone to /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini to section
> 
> [Date]
> ; Defines the default timezone used by the date functions
> ; http://php.net/date.timezone
> date.timezone = "Europe/Prague"
> You can find more info about timezones at php.net/date.timezone.
> 
> After reloading Apache configuration everything was ok.
