# gitscribe 写电子书的最佳方案

写好后程序帮你生成为各种格式

> Initialize a new book with init:
> 
>      $ git scribe init <directory name>
> 
> This will set up the outline for your book. All the book content goes into the book subdirectory with book.asc as the starting point. If you want to split the writing up into multiple files you can simply include them in the book.asc file. The generated files have an example of this.
> 
> Then you can generate your book content with the git scribe gen command:
> 
>     $ git scribe gen [site|html|pdf|epub|mobi|all]
