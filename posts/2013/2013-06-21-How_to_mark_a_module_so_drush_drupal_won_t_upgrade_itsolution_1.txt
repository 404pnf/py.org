# How to mark a module so drush/drupal won't upgrade itsolution 1

     drush pm-updatecode --lock=module_to_ignore
	 
solution 2

     Something like this in a drushrc.php file will probably work:
	 $command_specific['pm-update']['lock'] = array(
	   'module1',
	   'module2',
	   'module3'
		   );

Create a file named drushrc.php if it's not in your drush directory.
