# van tickets

1)  One-way tickets from Beijing to Shenyang  -- Sunday, December 16 (most preferably depart in early afternoon arriving into Shenyang late afternoon)

2) One-way tickets from Shenyang to Shanghai (Honqiao Airport?) -- Tuesday, December 18 (most preferably depart in early afternoon arriving into Shanghai mid-evening)

For purchasing the air fares, here are my passport information and that of Asm. Allen:

a)  Tran, Van Thai; DOB: 10/19/1964; US Passport # 039183836; Expiration Date: March 11, 2015

b)  Allen, Travis; DOB: 09/14/1973; US Passport # 039341703; Expiration Date: May 19, 2015 I will get the ticket info no later than tomorrow and get back to you.

I read a piece of news about Allen's campaign and mostly about how you made him a dark horse several weeks ago.

Do tell me if you need me to pick you up in the airport.
