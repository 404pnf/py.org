姓 名 字 的字 英文是 style 。 想不到吧。 更确切应该说 [chinese style name](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese\_style\_name) > A Chinese style name, sometimes also known as a courtesy name (zì), is a given name to be used later in life. After 20 years of age, the zì is assigned in place of one's given name as a symbol of adulthood and respect. Primarily used for male names, one could be given a zì by the parents, or adopt a self chosen zì later. The tradition of using style names has been fading away since the May Fourth Movement. There are two common forms of style name, the zì and the hào.
