# 企鹅 企鹅

different take based on probably the same material revenge of the penguin http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmd59Pbym2U brokeback penguin http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaMr5TXNZic at first, i didn't get the second one's reference at all. what's brokeback? 后背摔坏了？ then i got the gay reference, and thought could be DuanBiShan? didn't watch the movie. 估计没意思。unless someone i trust for his/her taste of movie convince me otherwise. 第一个倒是明白，感觉剪辑的也很好。就是不知道哪个电影。那么俗的名字的电影太多了，况且我也都没看过说不定。
