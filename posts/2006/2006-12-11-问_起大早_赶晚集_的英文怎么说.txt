# 问 起大早 赶晚集 的英文怎么说

我今天可谓是“起大早 赶晚集”

让我把它翻译成 start early, finish late 吧

i woke up and then got up pretty early.  
Brush my teeth, wash my face, you know,  
the usual, and put on some cream on my  
face, hehe, this is something special  
today, haha, and don't forget the take a  
dump.

anyway, i had a good breakfast, smashed  
juice (? it's called guo3 rou4 ji1, not  
exactly zha4 zhi1 ji1) of a tomato,  
a cucumber, a orange and a bag of milk, some bread.

then i took another dump

then i wondered around in the  
apartment, feeling unresolved?!(what  
does this word mean？) it's still early,k right?

suddenly i got a glimpse of the clock,  
damn, i was late.

sigh, a chinese idiom came to me, it's  
called: "qi3 da4 zao3, gan3 wan3 ji2", i  
loosely translate it as "start early,  
finish late"

anyone can come up with a better  
translation?
