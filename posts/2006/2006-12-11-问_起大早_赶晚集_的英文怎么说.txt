# 问 起大早 赶晚集 的英文怎么说

<p>我今天可谓是“起大早 赶晚集”</p>
<p>让我把它翻译成 start early, finish late 吧</p>
<p>i woke up and then got up pretty early.<br />
Brush my teeth, wash my face, you know,<br />
the usual, and put on some cream on my<br />
face, hehe, this is something special<br />
today, haha, and don't forget the take a<br />
dump.</p>
<p>anyway, i had a good breakfast, smashed<br />
juice (? it's called guo3 rou4 ji1, not<br />
exactly zha4 zhi1 ji1) of a tomato,<br />
a cucumber, a orange and a bag of milk, some bread.</p>
<p>then i took another dump</p>
<p>then i wondered around in the<br />
apartment, feeling unresolved?!(what<br />
does this word mean？) it's still early,k right? </p>
<p>suddenly i got a glimpse of the clock,<br />
damn, i was late.</p>
<p>sigh, a chinese idiom came to me, it's<br />
called: "qi3 da4 zao3, gan3 wan3 ji2", i<br />
 loosely translate it as "start early,<br />
finish late"</p>
<p>anyone can come up with a better<br />
translation?</p>
