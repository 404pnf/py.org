# 太监的英文是eunuch

说完[黄瓜和小妾](http://pengyou.rijiben.org/node/893)我们说太监。这个恐怕也是个大家想知道觉得好玩的词。 > [define: eunuch](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&newwindow=1&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&hs=HNE&sa=X&oi=spell&resnum=0&ct=result&cd=1&q=define:+eunuch&spell=1) > a man who has been castrated and is incapable of reproduction; "eunuchs guarded the harem" > wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn > A eunuch is a castrated human male. The castration can be only of the testes, or also include the penis, known as a penectomy (often with a tube inserted to keep the urethra open, called a urethral rerouting). The practice was established before 700 BC and accounts of eunuchs are known throughout history. > en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunuch 我想太监的中文意思不用我说了。现在打开电视各个台都有他们的身影。 [define:castrate](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&newwindow=1&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&hs=nQE&q=define%3Acastrate&btnG=Search) > Castration, gelding, neutering, orchiectomy or orchidectomy is any action, surgical, chemical or otherwise, by which a biological male loses use of the testes. This causes sterilization, i.e. prevents them from reproducing; it also greatly reduces the production of certain hormones, such as testosterone. It should not be confused with penectomy, which is the whole or partial removal of the penis. > en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castrate > eunuch: a man who has been castrated and is incapable of reproduction; "eunuchs guarded the harem" > wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn 不过，说点和英语学习无关的，你知道[太监那里是怎么割的么](http://pengyou.rijiben.org/node/900)？哈哈
