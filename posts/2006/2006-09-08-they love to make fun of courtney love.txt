they love to make fun of courtney love http://youtube.com/watch?v=B59cBAwqWZc 听前注意，有脏字啊 本歌“改编”自schoolhouse rock? http://www.schoolhouserock.tv/Unpack.html 里面有不少学习小知识的童谣类的歌词 reminds me of regan fox's fantastic take on her http://foxinthecity.libsyn.org/index.php?post\_id=13874 fox and the city is a fabulous comedy podcast http://foxinthecity.libsyn.org/ http://www.flickr.com/photos/vjnet/212377743/ i dont get it, just because regan is gay so his show is nominated for glbt (what's the creteria there, being a glbt or catering specific for glbt groups. i thihk fatC has a much wider audience base). i love distorted view too but fatC is much more fun then that. Regan is thrilled by the nomination http://foxinthecity.libsyn.org/index.php?post\_id=114672
