Is google censoring the N work in define word search

In google search, [define: nwa](http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3A+nwa&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official) > NWA is a three-letter abbreviation for > en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NWA an abbreviation for what? Now, i understand google doesn't censor the N word in it's search result. There could be some consideration why they do this for "define: word" search. I want to know what the rules are. I am not blaming them for this. Background: I was [writing a post](http://pengyou.rijiben.org/node/915) about this year's safest/dangerous cities in US and I mentioned Compton, and of course the city name brought me the name of NWA and straight outta compton and dre, snoop, etc. So I wanted my friends who didn't get the reference did some futhur reading. I used "define: nwa" in google. I found the above mentioned problem. Therefore, this post and my quesiton to bb readers. Since wikipedia is blocked in China so finally I typed out the defination of nwa in my article. A bit more typing, but an interesting finding.
