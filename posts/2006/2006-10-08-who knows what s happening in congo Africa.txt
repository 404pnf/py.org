who knows what s happening in congo Africa

yesterday morning, i watched cnn for a few seconds. A documentary called "Africa--the land of shame" was on. It mainly tells the massacre and rapes in Darfur,Congo. I don't know too much about international politics, esp what is happening on the far-away land of africa. I was just shocked by the misery suffered by the african people there. Africa is putting on a new "les miserable" a hell on earth. Did anybody notice that?
