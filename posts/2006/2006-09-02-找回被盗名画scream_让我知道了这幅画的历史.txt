这幅画谁看都眼熟，我一直以为是梵高什么的呢。今天看了看历史。原来它是挪威印象派画家Edvard Munch在1893年的作品。

> The Scream (Skrik, 1893) is a seminal series of expressionist paintings by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch. Regarded by many as his most important work, it is said by some to symbolize modern man taken by an attack of existential angst, with the skyline inspired by the red twilights seen after the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa.
