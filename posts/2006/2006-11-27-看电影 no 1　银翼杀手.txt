看电影 no 1　银翼杀手

气氛灰蒙蒙的，压抑，让人对未来世界很没信心。 剧情简单，一碗白开水。 其实是个伦理片，不过其伦理性一句话就能概括，而且是个简单句。 最后看到那个女的做着体操动作跳过来时，恍然大悟：我考，这片子我小时候看过（寒～）。 很容易看睡着了，我觉得不好看。 depressing gray mood, make people feel unconfident for the future. simple content, like blank water. actually it's a ethic film, but you can use a single sentence to summarize its ethic. when i saw the girl jumped as an gymnastic athlete , I recalled surprisedly: shit, I have seen the film when i was a child! easily feel sleepy, and i dislike the film.
