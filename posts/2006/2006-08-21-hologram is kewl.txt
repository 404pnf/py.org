A hologram is a three-dimensional scene with an incredible illusion of depth and motion that is unlike anything you've seen before. These holograms can be appreciated without glasses or a special viewing device. XYZ Imaging has created a new breed of large format, color static (non-rainbow) reflective holograms that astound viewers, gathers crowds and becomes the hot topic of conversation wherever they are displayed.
