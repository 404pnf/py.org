>  The Demilitarized Zone (or DMZ) in Korea is a strip of land running across the Korean Peninsula that serves as a buffer zone between North and South Korea. The DMZ cuts the Korean Peninsula roughly in half, crossing the 38th parallel on an acute angle, with the west end of the DMZ lying south of the parallel and the east end lying north of it. It is 248 km long and approximately 4 km wide.

dmz的中文是。。？停火区？军事停火区吧？ 


只是想告诉大家不光朝鲜半岛有dmz。只不过那个停火区现在还存在并“使用着”。不知道如何表达那个正在使用中。

今天看到这个词是在越南旅游的一篇文章。以前提过着个人的游记。


> Anyway, Hue was … okay. Depending on where else you have been in Asia and how much time you are spending in Vietnam, I might recommend giving it a miss, unless you really want to go the DMZ or something, although since the DMZ is apparently just a few concrete bunkers and some old photos, I'm not sure why you'd care. But I'll get into that more in a different post.
