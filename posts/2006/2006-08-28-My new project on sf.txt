java-cs-bridge is a simple and high efficacious tool for : serlializing the Java/C# object to binary stream or deserialing the binary stream to Java/C# object. thus the Java language and C# language can talk with each other. java-cs-bridge is: 1. easy to use. it has only few APIs you need to known. 2. compact. because it serializes the object to binary stream directly, it reduces much bandwidth than XML format. 3. high speed. beacause it manipulates the binary stream directly, it avoids many reflecting operation. so it is faster than serlizition to XML format.
