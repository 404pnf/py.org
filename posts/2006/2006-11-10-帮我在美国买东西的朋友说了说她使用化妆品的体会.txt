# 帮我在美国买东西的朋友说了说她使用化妆品的体会

因为朋友是越南裔美国人。所以皮肤跟咱们应该差不多吧。大家用什么化妆品也可以互相谈谈体会。吃什么维生素也可说说。眼看就12月了。我想咱们要抓紧拉单子了。 你们发的相关文章在文章分类的自由tagging中，写上团购，就能很方便地被我找到。我会尽快建立一个组。 > Hi 404, > I have been a model for 11 years. Doing print jobs, commercial and runway. I have used a lot of different types make-up products. Some of the products that I best recommend is LAURA MERCIER. This product is great for foundation. It gives me a perfect cover and a glossy look to it. Their blushes add a shimmering glow to your face. MAC is great for eye shadows. They have beautiful colors and it lasted very long. Their brushes are very soft too. AVEDA is an organic product, where they only used herbs. I used there powder, which gives me a perfect ending. > Cyndi 好心朋友帮大家把这段话[翻译一下](http://blog.fltrp.com/tingda/index.php/%E5%9B%A2%E8%B4%AD)好么。谢谢了。
