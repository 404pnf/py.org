# 看电影2 sin city

周日陪lp复习了一遍sin city。 属于拍的比较牛的片子之一。 黑白片子加上时不时弥漫出来的红色和黄色， 十分有视觉冲击力。 好像姜文的鬼子来了最后那段也用了该手法。 片子稍微暴力了点， 不过人物刻画和拍摄手法都很好。 演员也很好。 即使你不喜欢黑色和暴力， 这也是一部值得一看的片子。 last weekend I reviewed sin city with my wife. it is one of the coolest movies. black and white film but uses red or yellow to demostrate the blood or sex sometimes. it's full of impact. I remember the Guizilaile of JiangWen also used this way in the end of movie. it is a bit too violence. but the gesture of shoot and character profile are very good. although maybe you dislike black and violence movie. It is still a movie you shouldnt miss .
