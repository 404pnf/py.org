# 还说英语的张三和李四 john doe richard roe

再次声明，个人理解，也是为了大家好玩，我的说法和翻译都不一定正确。

开始吧。

先看看历史上为什么会用john doe和richard roe来指代张三你李四

> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Roe

> The "John Doe" custom dates back to the reign of England's King Edward III, during the legal debate over something called the Acts of Ejectment. This debate involved a hypothetical landowner, referred to as "John Doe," who leased land to another man, the equally fictitious "Richard Roe," who then took the land as his own and "ejected," or evicted, poor "John Doe."

哦，在爱的华三世的英国有一个法律辩论，关于地主张三把地阻给了李四。可这李四后来把地归为己有。废了（evicted）可怜的张三老爷。这个废了可不是暴力打残人家。是不理你这茬了。反正就是规我了。知道怎么翻译的出来说说。
