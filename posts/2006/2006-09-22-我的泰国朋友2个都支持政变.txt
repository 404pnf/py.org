一个发给了一篇转的文章说他信的腐败 另一个自己写了回复 >Hi Bai, > >Thanks so much.I, K@@@ and Thai people is pleased about the coup d' etate. > >The former Prime Minister(Thaksin Shinawatra) should go to hell, the cheat and corruption. > >the situation in Thailand is fine, do not worry. (Because of our beloved King) > >Please tell Chinese, Thais is very happy so much. > >Miss U > >K@@ 新闻我没怎么看也没兴趣。周二晚上偶然听到新闻里面说。说是偶然，是因为我基本不看电视，更不看新闻。：） 说到泰国国王，有机会我想请国内熟悉的朋友说说泰国人为什么那么尊敬他们的国王。 here another one >hahaha..i am ok and i know and am sure that all honest people are safe. >thank you very much for your wish... >Thaksin is corrupted and worst as we have ever had the PM. >The coup d'etat leader is good and honest person. >Sometime the country which its majority of people lack of education >can't maintain the democracy themselves. >I had waited for today, Bai! 虽然我不太同意有些说法，因为颇有精英政治的味道。但我很高兴我的朋友们很好他们也很高兴。 这种似乎是泰国媒体拍的？ [img\_assist|nid=346|title=thai-dream-reform-3|desc=|link=node|align=left|width=200|height=139] and finally, sth to feed my ego :) i am breaking the news as a blogger/citizen journlist etc whatve i got the permission from my thai friend to post the photos she took. thank you, keng. I will probably be the first chinese blogger to break the news by posting first hand photos taking by ordianry thai people. To look at the incident through thai people's own perspective but not big media companies. :)
