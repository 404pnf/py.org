a joke to share in the book I m reviewing at the moment

There are these two men out hunting, somewhere in Scotland, and suddenly one of them falls to the ground, his eyes are misty and he doesn't seem to be breathing. So, of course, the other one is in a sort of panic, I mean, he doesn't know what to do. so he calls the emergency services on his mobile phone, and tells the person on the other end, the operator, what has happened. The operator replies in a sort of calm reassuring voice, "OK, I can help you. But first make sure that he's dead." There is a moment of silence, then the operator hears a shopt, and the guy comes back, and he's sounding happier now, and says, "OK, I've done that, what do I do next?"
