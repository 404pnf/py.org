# 最近看的碟和准备看的

昨天看了半个多小时 [little man](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0430304/) 应该是那个[wayans兄弟](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0915465/)(spell?)的。就是3个黑人兄弟，他们编写和拍了scary movie之类的不少搞笑电影。 片子很一般。很一般。比以前他们的作品差很多。 前一段买盘一直没看的有 curb your enthusiasm 和 west wing 1 - 7 和 seinfield 1- 9 seinfield不用说，以前也说过。我喜欢。可是从第4季开始，看了个头，笑料比较夸张了，还是更喜欢observational humor那种。 [curb your enthusiam](http://www.hbo.com/larrydavid/)看了一集。明显手持dv拍的。但挺精彩。可能是pilot show，1）没钱 2）也用不着那些设备。这个片子是幽默也是我喜欢的类型。后面的还没看。即使画面声音也是比较粗糙，我也会看。因为好看。就像我会听64kb的我喜欢的音乐，也不会听什么超清晰的某某某歌星的歌。 westing wing看了半集。从第3季开始看。前面的几年前看过。现在不太吸引我了。 我不看电视主要是为了保护眼睛。 > Curb Your Enthusiasm is an American television sitcom starring Seinfeld co-creator and writer Larry David.
