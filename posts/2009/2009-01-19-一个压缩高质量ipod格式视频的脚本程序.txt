一个压缩高质量ipod格式视频的脚本程序

[diveintomark.org的作者](http://diveintomark.org/about)参与的自由软件项目。 http://code.google.com/u/pilgrim/ 我关注的是 > http://code.google.com/p/podencoder/ > This is a small (one file!) script for Linux users who want to encode video for fifth-generation video iPods. Its focus is on high-quality encodes (at the expense of being quite slow on older machines). It can encode one or more tracks from a physical DVD, ripped DVD (VIDEO\_TS folder), or a video file in any format readable by mplayer/mencoder.
