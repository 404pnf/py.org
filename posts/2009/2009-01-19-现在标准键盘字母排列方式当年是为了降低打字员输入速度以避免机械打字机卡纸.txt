# 现在标准键盘字母排列方式当年是为了降低打字员输入速度以避免机械打字机卡纸

如果这是真的，那我们太悲哀了！！真像有的笑话中说的，我们为什么要这么做，虽然看着不合理，但古人一直是这样。现在想不出古人的道理，但当时肯定有道理。我们继续这么做就好了。

> Computer Keyboard Layout

> There are a huge number of stupid designs around us embraced by the massing morons. One of them is the computer keyboard layout commonly known as QWERTY layout. It was a layout design that is meant to slow down typists, so that the early mechanical typewriters can be prevented from jamming. To this day, this QWERTY intentionally-slow layout is now the de facto “standard”. What i hate in the computer industry are those who out of laziness refused to learn touch type and therefore dismiss it. And, upon hearing the better design DVORAK, dismiss it as fussing. Keyboard punching morons: die.
