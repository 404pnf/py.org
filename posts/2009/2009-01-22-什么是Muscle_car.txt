# 什么是Muscle car

> Muscle car is a term used to refer to a variety of high performance automobiles14.[1]15[2]16 The term principally refers to American, Australian and to a lesser extent South African models. It generally describes a 2-door rear wheel drive17 mid-size car18 with a large, powerful V8 engine19, and at an affordable price. Although opinions vary, it is generally accepted that classic muscle cars were produced in the late 1960s and early 1970s.[3]20[4]21[5]22[6]23 Muscle cars were built for street use and in some cases racing24. They are distinct from sports cars25 and also from GTs26, which are two-seat or 2+227 cars intended for high-speed touring/road racing28. These are not generally considered muscle cars owing to their small size, relatively high cost and specialty nature. > > > > ![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Pontiac\_GTO\_1966.jpg/300px-Pontiac\_GTO\_1966.jpg) 原来这类车有专有名词。如何翻译该条目的名称到英文就为难了。得资讯喜欢玩车的朋友，估计最后会用到相应黑话。：）
