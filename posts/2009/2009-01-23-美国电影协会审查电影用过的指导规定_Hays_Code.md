> The Production Code (popularly known as the Hays11 Code or the Breen12 Office) was the set of industry censorship guidelines, and the office enforcing them, which governed the production of United States motion pictures13 from 1930 to 1968. The Motion Pictures Producers and Distributors Association (MPPDA), which later became the Motion Picture Association of America14 (MPAA), adopted the code in 193015, began effectively enforcing it in 193416, and abandoned it in 196817 in favor of the subsequent MPAA film rating system18. The Production Code spelled out what was morally acceptable19 and morally unacceptable content for motion pictures produced for a public audience in the United States.
