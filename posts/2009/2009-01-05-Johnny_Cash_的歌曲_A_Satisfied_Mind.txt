> Johnny Cash - A Satisfied Mind Lyrics
> 
> How many times have
> You heard someone say
> If I had his money
> I could do things my way
> 
> But little they know
> That it's so hard to find
> One rich man in ten
> With a satisfied mind
> 
> Once I was waitin'
> In fortune and fame 
> Everything that I dreamed for
> To get a start in life's game 
> 
> Then suddenly it happened
> I lost every dime 
> But I'm richer by far
> With a satisfied mind 
> 
> Money can't buy back
> Your youth when you're old
> Or a friend when you're lonely
> Or a love that's grown cold
> 
> The wealthiest person
> Is a pauper at times
> Compared to the man
> With a satisfied mind
> 
> When my life has ended
> And my time has run out
> My friends and my loved ones
> I'll leave there's no doubt
> 
> But one thing's for certain
> When it comes my time
> I'll leave this old world
> With a satisfied mind
> 
> How many times have
> You heard someone say
> If I had his money
> I could do things my way
> 
> But little they know
> That it's so hard to find
> One rich man in ten
> With a satisfied mind
