# 顺手回答 account executive是什么职位

[问题地址](http://www.douban.com/group/topic/5444608/)

account executive属销售代表，指职位较高的销售人员，内地通常做“客户总监”之类的。因为常把executive做总监讲。如果公司还有销售经理，那么account executive比经理高一位。

这里的account不是帐目，而是指客户（client或者customer）。account executive负责维护公司和某位或多位客户的交易及关系。

但是在广告公司中，account executive是个初级职位。只比account coordinator（客户协调）高一级。因为这里，executive取“执行”的意思。

> In larger organizations, account executives are given direct responsibility for the dealings with one or more high volume customers or clients. These customers or clients, referred to as accounts, are important to the organization's success, and so an account executive is necessary to manage one or more persons dedicated to serving the needs of the transactions and relationships with the customer.

> In the advertising industry, account executives are the second-lowest-ranking members of the client service department, outranking only entry-level account coordinators.[citation needed] The word "executive" here means to "execute" - that is they are mostly responsible for more practical parts of the advertising jobs (ie leaflets, distributions, adaptations of materials from different languages etc). They answer to the respective account supervisor and/or to the client service director/account director. That depends on the country and on the account you are working for. In Spain for example, an account executive could probably develop very important campaigns on his/her own.[citation needed]
