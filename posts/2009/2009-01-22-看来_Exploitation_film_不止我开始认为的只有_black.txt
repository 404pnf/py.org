批评界如何定义和翻译这个词？ > Exploitation film > From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia > Jump to: navigation4, search5 > > Exploitation film is a type of film that is promoted by "exploiting" often lurid subject matter. The term "exploitation" is common in film marketing, used for all types of films to mean promotion or advertising. Thus, films need something to "exploit", such as a big star, special effects, sex, violence, romance, etc. An "exploitation film", however relies heavily on sensationalist advertising and broad and lurid overstatement of the issues depicted, regardless of the intrinsic quality of the film. Very often, exploitation films were of low quality in every sense. This, however, was not always the case. Exploitation films sometimes attract critical attention and cult followings. > > http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploitation\_film 可以称为“媚俗的俗片”？
