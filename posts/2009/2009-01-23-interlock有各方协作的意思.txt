interlock有各方协作的意思

看到一封信写： > This is a feed-back from our previous interlock with COMPANY A, pls help schedule a meeting after spring festival. 这linterlock什么意思根据上下文能猜出来。但从没见过这个用法。于是查了一下。 当名词 > Noun > > + S: (n) interlock, ignition interlock (a device that prevents an automotive engine from starting) "car theives know how to bypass the ignition interlock" > + S: (n) mesh, meshing, interlock, interlocking (the act of interlocking or meshing) "an interlocking of arms by the police held the crowd in check" 那肯定取名词第2个解释啦。那怎么翻译好呢？感觉怎么都不合适啊？用这个词就不合适。 当动词 > + coordinate in such a way that all parts work together effectively > + lock: hold in a locking position; "He locked his hands around her neck" > + a device that prevents an automotive engine from starting; "car theives know how to bypass the ignition interlock" > + become engaged or intermeshed with one another; "They were locked in embrace" > + mesh: the act of interlocking or meshing; "an interlocking of arms by the police held the crowd in check" > wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn > http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn%3Fs%3Dinterlock&usg=AFQjCNFXS8e5NWqp4zTvwJ7Jl5LIgN\_DwA
