今天看介绍NYT文章中说，该报除了体育和书评等栏目，对涉及到的人都用hoorific称呼。

看了 honorific 条目的解释，应该是 尊称 的意思。是不？

> <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorific>
> An honorific is a word or expression that conveys esteem or respect when used in addressing or referring to a person. "Honorific" may refer broadly to the style of language or particular words or grammatical markings used in this way, including words used to express honor to one perceived as a social superior. Sometimes the term is used not quite correctly to refer to a title of honor (honorary title).
> 
> Non-honorific forms, that is forms which explicitly avoid being honorific, are often called familiar forms. Thus Sie is 'you honorific' in German, while du is 'you familiar'. Modern English you, in contrast, is neither honorific nor familiar, since it can be used in both ways.
> 
> Typically honorifics are used for second and third persons; use for first person is less common. Some languages have anti-honorific or despective first person forms (meaning something like "your most humble servant" or "this unworthy person") whose effect is to enhance the relative honor accorded a second or third person.
> 
> Modern English honorifics
> 
> The most common honorifics in modern English are usually placed immediately before the name of the subject. Honorifics which can be used of any adult of the approriate sex include "Mr.", "Mrs.", "Miss", and "Ms.". Other honorifics denote the honored person’s occupation, for instance "Doctor", "Coach", Officer, "Father" (for a priest), or "Professor". Abbreviations of academic degrees, used after a person's name, may also be seen as a kind of honorific (e.g. "Jane Doe, Ph.D.")
> 
> Some honorifics act as complete replacements for a name, as "sir" or "ma'am", or "your honor". Subordinates will often use honorifics as punctuation before asking a superior a question or after responding to an order: "Yes, sir" or even "Sir, yes sir."
> 
> These honorifics are usually limited to formal situations, or when children address adults.
