我都不知道啊。怎么没人通知啊。 > ![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e1/Death\_Proof\_%28Netherlands%29.jpg/200px-Death\_Proof\_%28Netherlands%29.jpg) > 好名字。我看翻译成“死不了”会很有意思。哈哈。但这么翻译，就没有恐怖的味道了。 > Death Proof > From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia > > Death Proof is a 200734 film35 written and directed by Quentin Tarantino36. The film centers around a psychopathic37 stunt man38 who stalks young women before murdering them in staged car accidents using his "death proof" stunt car. The film is a tribute to muscle car39, exploitation, and slasher film40 genres of the 1970s41. The film stars Kurt Russell42, Zoë Bell43, Rosario Dawson44, Vanessa Ferlito45, Jordan Ladd46, Sydney Poitier47, Tracie Thoms48, Mary Elizabeth Winstead49 and Rose McGowan50. > > Death Proof was released theatrically in the United States51 as part of a double feature52 with Robert Rodriguez53's Planet Terror54 under the collective title Grindhouse55 in order to replicate the experience of viewing exploitation film56 double features in a "grindhouse57" theater. The films were released separately on DVD, with Death Proof going on sale in the United States on September 1858, 200759. > http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death\_Proof 估计片子一般。因为我也没经历和看过该片要致敬的70年代那种恐怖片。 谁有借我看看。
