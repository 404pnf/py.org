Linux Terminal Server Project LTSP

> K12Linux is Linux Terminal Server Project (LTSP) for Fedora. This enables any Fedora machine to become a terminal server, serving a network bootable thin client operating system over a network to diskless clients. The primary benefit of diskless clients in the LTSP model is extreme cost savings from central management and central authentication. > > https://fedorahosted.org/k12linux/ 我最感兴的就是一台主机带20－50个屏幕。学校和网吧用。
