nfs中数据库授权的问题

## first support request

Default mysql account can't grant privilege

0. jsmith is my account name 
1. jsmith is the default database user I got, using same passwd with login
2. jsmith created a database: pantao.
3. jsmith created a user: pantao
4. jsmith tried to grant privilege on database panto to user pantao 
5. operation failed: 

     GRANT SELECT , INSERT , UPDATE , DELETE , CREATE , DROP , INDEX , ALTER ON `pantao` . * TO 'pantao'@'%';


      #1044 - Access denied for user 'jsmith'@'%' to database 'pantao' 

6. jsmith has all privilage on all database('jsmith'@'%' ) except FILE and GRANT.

7. jsmith can't grant himself FILE and GRANT privilage: 

      GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'jsmith'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION MAX_QUERIES_PER_HOUR 0 MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR 0 MAX_UPDATES_PER_HOUR 0 MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 0 ;

      #1045 - Access denied for user 'jsmith'@'%' (using password: YES)


ref: issue 29381

Jsmith wants to grant user he created the privilage to work on datebase jsmith created. How to do that?

Thank you!

yonghu02/XUKj3xm8TTddwuvj


When create a new user, this is what i filled in: 

      user name ; use text filed ; yonghu02
      host ; any host;
      passwd ; XUK3jxmT8Tddwuvj
      re-type; XUK3jxmT8Tddwuvj
      
      database for user;
      None

      Global privilege;
      Didn't check anything

I got error message:

      Error
      
      SQL query:
      
      CREATE USER 'yonghu02'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '****************';
      
      GRANT USAGE ON * . * TO 'yonghu02'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY
      '****************' WITH MAX_QUERIES_PER_HOUR 0
      MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR 0 MAX_UPDATES_PER_HOUR 0
      MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 0 ;
      
      MySQL said: Documentation
      #1045 - Access denied for user 'jsmith'@'%' (using password: YES) 



I only grant 5 privilege for a user, that's very minimal. I still have the errro.

      Error
      
      SQL query: Documentation
      
      GRANT SELECT , INSERT , UPDATE , CREATE , INDEX , ALTER ON
      `pantao` . * TO 'pantao'@'%';

## third support request


1. I read the related FAQ again.

2. That entry was updated after I asked this question (issue 29381).

3. By repeating what the FAQ said over 10 times, I think I know how to properly create a user and a database. And I succeed over 10 times.

4. What I've been failing from the beginning is to **grant** privilege to other database users. I didn't grant all privileges, just 5 of them

      GRANT SELECT , INSERT , UPDATE , CREATE , INDEX , ALTER ON
      `pantao` . * TO 'pantao'@'%';

5. I think I know why: my default mysql account doesn't have the right of GRANT for any database it created: 


      User  	Host  	Type  	Privileges  	Grant  	Action
      jsmith 	% 	global 	ALL PRIVILEGES 	No 	Edit Privileges

6. That is the privilege page of any database jsmith created.

7. Would you please, read item 5 and 6 in the original question in this issue again?

8. If, again, that particular entry is the answer. Would you please guess where could i possibly go wrong in doing that 2 simple tasks? What kind of info should I provide. Something like this helpful?

When create a new user, this is what i filled in: 

      user name ; use text filed ; yonghu02
      host ; any host;
      passwd ; XUK3jxmT8Tddwuvj
      re-type; XUK3jxmT8Tddwuvj
      
      database for user;
      None

      Global privilege;
      Didn't check anything

I got error message, but the user is created neverthless:

      Error
      
      SQL query:
      
      CREATE USER 'yonghu02'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '****************';
      
      GRANT USAGE ON * . * TO 'yonghu02'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY
      '****************' WITH MAX_QUERIES_PER_HOUR 0
      MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR 0 MAX_UPDATES_PER_HOUR 0
      MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 0 ;
      
      MySQL said: Documentation
      #1045 - Access denied for user 'jsmith'@'%' (using password: YES) 

9. It's the GRANT part that failed.



9. This ping-pong like support is frustrating.


## 问题解决了
不知道为什么我默认帐号失去了grant的权力。

nfs的人通过root帐号，只能在localhsot不能远程使用，重新给了我默认帐号grant权力。这就是说他们需要有工程师去机房完成这个工作。谢了！ ：）
