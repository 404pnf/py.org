# 存钱罐为什叫piggy bank 原来刚开始的时候它和猪没有联系的

## 老婆送我一个存钱罐。

很喜欢。因为我收集一元的普通人民币硬币。：）
于是想到存钱罐为什么叫piggy bank

##  piggy在这里本意不不表示猪

自己看下面的解释就可以了

谁能告诉我扑满这个词是怎么来的。我第一次听说。从来没听人用过，书面也没见到过。

> 扑满（粤语称为钱罂）是储存硬币的容器。在现代，扑满通常属于小朋友（成人多将钱储于银行），外形常见像猪，以陶制，只有一个小洞，如果真的要用就必须打破它。这个设计可以教育小孩储蓄的概念：钱可以入，但使用时必须慎重考虑。

## Piggy bank
> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
> 
> Piggy bank (sometimes penny bank or money box) is the traditional name of a coin accumulation and storage container; it is most often, but not exclusively, used by children. The piggy bank is known to collectors as a "still bank" as opposed to the "mechanical banks" popular in the early 20th century. These items are also often used by corporations for promotional purposes.
> 
> Piggy banks are typically made of ceramic or porcelain, and serve as a pedagogical device to teach the rudiments of thrift and savings to children; money can be easily inserted, but in the traditional type of bank the pig must be broken open for it to be retrieved. Most modern piggy banks, however, have a rubber plug located on the underside; others are made of vinyl and have a removable nose for easy coin access. Some piggy banks incorporate electronic systems which calculate the amount of money deposited.[citation needed]

> [edit] Etymology
> 
> In Middle English, "pygg" referred to a type of clay used for making various household objects such as jars. People often saved money in kitchen pots and jars made of pygg, called "pygg jars". By the 18th century, the spelling of "pygg" had changed and the term "pygg jar" had evolved to "pig bank."[citation needed]
> 
> Once the meaning had transferred from the substance to the shape, piggy banks began to be made from other substances, including glass, plaster, and plastic.
> 
> In a curious case of parallel evolution, the Indonesian term celengan (a celeng is a wild boar, with the "an" affix used to denote a likeness) was also used in the context of domestic banks. The etymology of the word is obscure, but evident in a Majapahit piggy bank from the 15 century A.D.
