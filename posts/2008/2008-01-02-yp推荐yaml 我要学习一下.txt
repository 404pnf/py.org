yp推荐yaml 我要学习一下

## yp推荐yaml，我要学习一下 http://www.yaml.org/ > YAML(tm) (rhymes with "camel") is a straightforward machine parsable data serialization format designed for human readability and interaction with scripting languages such as Perl and Python. YAML is optimized for data serialization, configuration settings, log files, Internet messaging and filtering. YAML(tm) is a balance of the following design goals: > > \* YAML documents are very readable by humans. > \* YAML interacts well with scripting languages. > \* YAML uses host languages' native data structures. > \* YAML has a consistent information model. > \* YAML enables stream-based processing. > \* YAML is expressive and extensible. > \* YAML is easy to implement. > 充这名字，我就得好好研究。好名字是自由软件项目成功的一办这个俗话真是不假。哈哈。：）
