# Mexican standoff 是什么

Mexican standoff 是什么

翻译成“墨西哥对峙”好么？对峙倒是一眼就能看出这个说法的意思。但没有了standoff这层最初的意思。

简单说就是电影中常见的相互制约：多个人，多种势力，拿枪互相对着。谁也不想开枪因为一旦一个开枪，就破坏了对峙的平衡，而且你开枪打别人时不能防止令一个人开枪打你（这点和两个人对峙谁先开枪击毙对方就安全了不一样），所以一旦动火，都是已的大家都玩完告终。当然，英雄人物总是能活下来。：）

本词条从19世纪晚期开始使用，最初是形容墨西哥人在政治上做决定摇摆不定，很难下决心，贬义，且有侮辱墨西哥人的口气。

下面是wikipedia上更具体的解释。

> The phrase came into usage during the late 19th century. Originally a derogatory reference to perceived Mexican political indecision,[1] it has come to refer to any impasse, regardless of the participants or the presence of arms.

> In popular culture, the Mexican standoff is often portrayed as multiple opponents with weapons aimed at each other,[2] such that each opponent feels equally threatened and does not believe they can strike first without endangering their own life; not only does any initial shot decisively destroy the unstable equilibrium of multiple deterrence, shooting any one person takes one's aim away from the other opponent. [3][4] The Mexican standoff is now largely considered a movie cliché due to its frequent use in spaghetti westerns and action films.[citation needed]
