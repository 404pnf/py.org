为了让美元稳定（甚至短期rally），美国财政部的ESF卖了大量欧元来挺美元；看好esf的动作就能知道它卖完欧元的一天，美元迅速编制的压力就会大、大、再大。让美元跌、再跌。

> The very large drop recently (the blue line) tells part of the story. Another part is told by the Treasury site itself - that recent data about the drop was delayed for almost three weeks before it was made public.

> What the ESF did is simply sold about 10 billion Euros and bought dollars - plain and simple massive intervention that virtually everyone has missed or ignored or pretended doesn't exist or whatever.

关键是听这个节目。每气都听。有意思，而且有收获。karmabanqueraido.com，我都说了多少遍了。：） 经济、幽默、政治、文化等等急于一身。

但如果你以前从没听过可能会解受不了而且完全不知所云。找到以前的节目，从2006年开始听就可以了。
