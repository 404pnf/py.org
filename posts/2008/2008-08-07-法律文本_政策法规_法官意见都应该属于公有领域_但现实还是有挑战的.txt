# 法律文本 政策法规 法官意见都应该属于公有领域 但现实还是有挑战的

法律文本，政策法规，法官意见都应该属于公有领域！但现实还是有挑战的。

> Citing the Veeck decision (7 June ’02), Carl Malamud and Public.Resource.Org have posted the building, fire, electrical, plumbing, and mechanical Public Safety Codes for the state of California.

> 
> >    The courts have long held that the law is public domain and must be available to all for use without restriction. While numerous organizations have attempted to assert copyright over judicial branch opinions, legislative branch statutes, and executive branch regulations, the courts have not looked kindly on these efforts to place a private wrapper around a public package. If we are to be a nation of laws, those laws must be accessible to all.
