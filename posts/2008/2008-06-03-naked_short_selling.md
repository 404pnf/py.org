## naked short selling

> Naked short selling, or naked shorting, is the practice of selling a stock short without first borrowing the shares or ensuring that the shares can be borrowed. Naked shorting is not necessarily a violation of the federal securities laws, and can contribute to market liquidity, but is illegal when it drives down stock prices.[1] In 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued "Regulation SHO" seeking to curb abusive naked shorting.[2]
