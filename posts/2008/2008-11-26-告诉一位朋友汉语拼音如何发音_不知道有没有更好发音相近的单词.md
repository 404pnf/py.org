> shanghai pudong xilaideng yoyo jiudian

let me break it down with english pronounciation

pinyin:  shanghai     pudong 	   xilaideng		 yoyo		 jiudian

shanghai: pronounced shan-high

pudong:  the district name, pronounced: poodon't(without the t) 

xilaideng: meaning shearton, pronounced:  see-lie-deng(or dong, english doesn't have the eng sound)

yoyo, meaning nothing, maybe the chinese management side name, pronounced: yoyo, like yoyo ball

jiudian, meaning hotel, pronounced: joe-dyan(like dee-an but pronounce it very fast: dyan)


let's link them together:

shanghai poo-don' see-lie-deng yoyo joe-dyan


Here's my suggestion: if you need to tell the driver or any service staff where do you want to go, just print the following characters out, they are the hotel name and address:

       上海浦东喜来登由由酒店
       浦建路 38 号 · 上海, 上海 200127 · 中国 · 地图
       电话: (86)(21) 5089 9999
