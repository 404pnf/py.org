郎平当年离开女排的原因

> Q: In the spring of 1987, why did you leave China to study in American at the prime of your career?
> A: At the time, I was the focus of attention in China.  We can understand why people wanted to impose the honor of the nation on us athletes.  But I wanted to live the life of an ordinary person.  At the time, I could not go anywhere.  I was too tall and I could not hide myself.  I cannot go to any public place or watch a movie.  I was tired of sitting in my room every day.  I wanted to find myself.  I wanted some place where I can put aside the radiant aura.  Volleyball is not very popular in the United States, and I may be able to live a normal life.  SO I went to New Mexico to become a graduate student in sport administration.  I started from zero.

我刚知道郎平是什么时候离开球队和为什么。她的原因在我看来非常充分。有名的运动员也要有自己的生活。
