monoline insurance

## monoline insurance > http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoline\_insurance > Monoline insurers (also referred to as "monoline insurance companies" or simply "monolines") guarantee the timely repayment of bond principal and interest when an issuer defaults. They are so named because they provide services to only one industry. [1] > > The economic value of bond insurance to the governmental unit, agency, or company offering bonds is a saving in interest costs reflecting the difference in yield on an insured bond from that on the same bond if uninsured. Insured securities range from municipal bonds and structured finance bonds to collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) domestically and abroad. > > Insurance regulations prevent property/casualty insurance companies, life insurance companies, and multiline insurance companies from offering financial guaranty insurance. The monoline industry claims that it has the advantage over multilines of sole focus on capital markets.[2] 可以看到，这里monoline是说它们的保险内容是单一内容的，而不是一般保险公司的multiline，多线，或者说多个内容。 在写[用三只小猪的故事来说现在的世界金融市场](http://pengyou.rijiben.org/node/1904)的故事时，我开始用的是modelized insurance。后来查了一下，更有可能是monoline insurance。所以我更正了，并专门查看一下这个词。 [Effect on municipal bond "monoline" insurers](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Subprime\_mortgage\_crisis&printable=yes#Effect\_on\_municipal\_bond\_.22monoline.22\_insurers)
