> I love cats. I love electronic music. If you're reading this blog, you'll enjoy this video. The audience remains unimpressed. The fact of the matter is most people playing a Theremin don't sound any better than this.

"The audience remians unimpressed" 这句最绝。最后2秒可以看到真有一位猫听众呢。：）


什么是theremin？。中文翻译为“特雷们”

> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin
> 
>  is one of the earliest electronic musical instruments, and the first musical instrument played without being touched (originally pronounced [ˈteremin] but often anglicized as IPA: /ˈθɛrəmɪn/[1], theramin,[2] or thereminvox, it is also known as an aetherphone.) It was invented by Russian inventor Lev Theremin (Russian: Лев Сергеевич Термен) in 1919,[citation needed]. The controlling section is usually two metal antennas to sense the position of the player's hands. These control audio oscillator(s) for frequency with one hand, and volume with the other. The electric signals from the theremin are amplified and sent to a loudspeaker. The theremin is a quintephone.
> 
> To play, the player moves his hands around the antennas, controlling frequency (pitch) and amplitude (volume). The theremin is associated with "alien", surreal, and eerie-sounding portamento, glissando, tremolo, and vibrato sounds, due to its use in film soundtracks such as Spellbound, The Lost Weekend, Ed Wood, Mars Attacks! (together with Ondes-Martenot and pre-recorded Theremin samples)[3] and The Day the Earth Stood Still. Theremins are also used in art music (especially avant-garde and 20th century "new music") and in popular music genres such as rock and pop. John Otway regularly uses a Theremin in his performances, Jean Michel Jarre also used it on his album Oxygene.

> Other electronic instruments, such as the Ondes-Martenot also use two heterodyning oscillators, but the Ondes-Martenot is touched while played.
