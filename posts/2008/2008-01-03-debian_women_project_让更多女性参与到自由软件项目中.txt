## debian women project

> The Debian Women project was founded in May 2004. We seek to balance and diversify the Debian Project by actively engaging with interested women and encouraging them to become more involved with Debian. We will promote women's involvement in Debian by increasing the visibility of active women, providing mentoring and role models, and creating opportunities for collaboration with new and current members of the Debian Project. We welcome the involvement of all people who are interested in increasing the participation of women in Debian.
