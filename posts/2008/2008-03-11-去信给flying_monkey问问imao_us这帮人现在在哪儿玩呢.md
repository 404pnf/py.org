## 去信给flying monkey问问imao.us这帮人现在在哪儿玩呢


我的信：Hi, flying~, is this really your first name. haha

I am a long time listener first time emailer of imao show. I listened to every episode of imao a few years back, and as the show name suggests, i laughed my ass off.

Seems to me the site was done for quite a long time. What happened. Ocassionally, there appeared to be a domain hajack!

I just want to download more shows, if there had been more shows. 

To prove I am Chinese, now some Chinese characters and the link to my blog post having the content of this email with many other Chinese posts. http://pengyou.rijiben.org/node/1925

Some crazy Chinese character: 飞猴，我非常喜欢imao。告诉我你们现在在哪里活动？ The previous chinese sentence can be translated as: flyingmonkey, I like imao very much. Tell me where you guys hangout nowadays?

I enjoyed your shows very much. Sorry for fell out of touch with the show for about 2-3 years but, update me on what's going on please. I really need some podcast comedy fix, as they are rare all alone. With a few exceptions: imao, technical difficulty, yeast radio (not a comdey show, but hillarious anyway). Now, i can't think of others. Though some hacker radio, like binrev and the ddpradio gang often made me laugh, too.

I Am A, Oh, Chinese citizen :) remember this one? All imao members were trashing a member for not mentiong imao in a phone call to a national syndicated talk radio show.  Right wingers~ hahah
