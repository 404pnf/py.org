nearlyfreespeech net上内存用完的问题

Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 33554432 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 2048 bytes) in /data/f4/content/ziyouwenhua/public/includes/theme.inc on line 724 I have this error msg on my site: Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 33554432 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 2048 bytes) in /data/f4/content/ziyouwenhua/public/includes/theme.inc on line 724 I am running 5 sites out of a single drupal code base. The traffic is very light, less then 50mb for all sites. This is line 724 function drupal\_find\_theme\_functions($cache, $prefixes) { $templates = array(); $functions = get\_defined\_functions(); \*\*line 724\*\* foreach ($cache as $hook => $info) { foreach ($prefixes as $prefix) { if (!empty($info['pattern'])) { $matches = preg\_grep('/^'. $prefix .'\_'. $info['pattern'] .'/', $functions['user']); if ($matches) { I didn't enable much modules. I always try to keep site as lean as possible. I also enabled cache in drupal, both page catch, block catch, css/js aggregation and compress. What seems to be the problem? 还没有解决。 TIA.
