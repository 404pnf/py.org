squirrel nut zippers乐队名字的来历是来自糖果牌子 这是我96/97年在电台听到，非常非常喜欢的乐队。而且一直想能参与到类似的风格。 大家想象一下，当年一个年轻人，非常喜欢传统爵士音乐，但又不知道如何和当下的音乐相结合。听了他们的歌曲，明白了。而且我喜欢有戏剧的音乐。 > 1990s > > The band was founded by Jim "Jimbo" Mathus, formerly of Metalflake Mother and Johnny Vomit & The Dry Heaves, and his then-wife Katharine Whalen in Carrboro, North Carolina along with Chris Phillips, Don Raleigh and Ken Mosher. The group made its debut in Chapel Hill a few months later. Stacy Guess (formerly of Pressure Boys) joined shortly after. The band's name comes from the Squirrel Brand's Nut Zippers, a peanut and caramel candy for sale since the mid-20s.[1] > > The band was initially lumped into the "lounge" movement, along with Combustible Edison, and credited as part of the brief swing music revival of the 1990s. The Zippers incorporated a broad range of music, ranging from Harlem Hot Music, Cab Calloway, Johnny Ace, Delta Blues, Raymond Scott, Fats Waller, Django Reinhardt, Tom Waits, and klezmer. > >
