# yellowface和blackface

yellowface和blackface > Yellowface is the practice in cinema, theatre, and television where East Asian characters are portrayed by predominantly white actors, often while wearing heavy makeup in order to approximate "Asian" or "Oriental" facial characteristics. > > Comparable to blackface, yellowface was once a commonly accepted practice in the motion picture industry, with many legendary Hollywood actors launching their careers by playing yellowface roles. Remarkably, the use of yellowface makeup endured well past the point when blackface makeup was regarded as a taboo. > > Robert Ito explains that job protection for caucasian actors was one reason yellowface persisted. "With the relatively small percentage of actors that support themselves by acting, it was only logical that they should try to limit the available talent pool as much as possible. One way of doing this was by placing restrictions on minority actors, which, in the case of Asian actors, meant that they could usually only get roles as houseboys, cooks, laundrymen, and crazed war enemies, with the rare "white hero's loyal sidekick" roles going to the big name actors. When the script called for a larger Asian role, it was almost inevitably given to a white actor." > http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowface > > > Blackface in the narrow sense is a style of theatrical makeup that originated in the United States, used to take on the appearance of certain archetypes of American racism, especially those of the happy-go-lucky darky on the plantation or the dandified coon.[citation needed] Blackface in the broader sense includes similarly stereotyped performances even when they do not involve blackface makeup. > http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackface > > > In the 1993 film Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story, Bruce Lee and his girl friend, Linda Emery, watch the film at the theater, but Linda suggest they leave midway after she notices that Bruce is upset at the stereotypical depiction of an Asian man portrayed by Mickey Rooney. > http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast\_at\_Tiffany%27s#Cultural\_references
