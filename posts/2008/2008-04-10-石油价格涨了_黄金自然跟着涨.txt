[Oil hits record high after US inventories](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/d9718494-0652-11dd-802c-0000779fd2ac.html)

> The jump in oil costs saw the price of corn, used to make ethanol, surge to a new all-time high of $6.16 a bushel, up 35 per cent since the start of the year.

> The International Monetary Fund warned on Wednesday that crude oil prices would remain at about $95 on average this year and the next, in spite of the slowdown in the world economy.

$95, are you kidding me? more likely $125

>Coal prices are also rising, with utilities in Asia this week accepting a 100 per cent rise in the annual price they pay for coal supplies. Steelmakers have agreed to pay up to 240 per cent more for coking coal.

wow...
