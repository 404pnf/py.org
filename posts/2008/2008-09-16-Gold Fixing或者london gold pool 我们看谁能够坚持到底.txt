It is designed to fix a price for settling contracts between members of the London bullion market, but informally the Gold Fixing provides a recognized rate that is used as a benchmark for pricing the majority of gold products and derivatives throughout the world's markets. The Gold Fixing is conducted twice a day by telephone, at 10:30 GMT and 15:00 GMT. > > The first fixing took place on 12 September 1919 amongst the five principal gold bullion traders and refiners of the day: N M Rothschild & Sons, Mocatta & Goldsmid, Pixley & Abell, Samuel Montagu & Co. and Sharps Wilkins. The gold price then was four pounds 18 shillings and ninepence (GBP 4.9375) per troy ounce. > > Due to wartime emergencies and government controls, the London Gold Fixing was suspended between 1939 and 1954. > > Gold prices are fixed in United States dollars (USD), Pound sterling (GBP) and European euros (EUR). > > On 21 January 1980 the Gold Fixing reached the price of $850, a figure not overtaken until 3 January 2008 when a new record of $865.35 per troy ounce was set in the a.m. Fixing.[1] However, when indexed for inflation, the 1980 high would equate to a price of $2398.21 in 2007 dollars, thus the 1980 record still holds in real terms. > > The Fixing historically took place twice daily at the City offices of N M Rothschild & Sons in St Swithin's Lane, but since 5 May 2004 it takes place by telephone. In April 2004 N M Rothschild & Sons announced that it planned to withdraw from gold trading and from the London Gold Fixing. Barclays Bank took its place from 7 June 2004, and the chairmanship of the meeting, formerly held permanently by Rothschilds, now rotates annually. > > A tradition of the London Gold Fixing was that participants could raise a small Union Flag on their desk to pause proceedings. Under the telephone fixing system, participants can register a pause by saying the word "flag", and the chair ends the meeting with the phrase "There are no flags, and we're fixed". > > The current five participants in the Fixing, who must be members of the London Bullion Market Association, are: > >+ Scotia-Mocatta — successor to Mocatta & Goldsmid and part of Bank of Nova Scotia >+ Barclays Capital — Replaced N M Rothschild & Sons when they abdicated >+ Deutsche Bank — Owner of Sharps Pixley, itself the merger of Sharps Wilkins with Pixley & Abell >+ HSBC — Owner of Samuel Montagu & Co. >+ Société Générale — Replaced Johnson Matthey and CSFB as fifth seat > > [edit] See also > >+ Gold standard >+ Gold as an investment > > [edit] References > > 1. ^ LBMA statistics > > [edit] External links > >+ Live Gold Fixing Price >+ Current Gold Fixing Price - a.m./p.m. >+ London Gold Fixing >+ Description of the fixing process from the London Bullion Market Association >+ Further description of the fixing process > > Retrieved from "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold\_Fixing" > Categories: Gold > > This page was last modified on 26 August 2008, at 08:59. > All text is available under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License.
