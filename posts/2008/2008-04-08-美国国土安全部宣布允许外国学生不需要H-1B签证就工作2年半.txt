## 美国国土安全部宣布允许外国学生不需要H-1B签证就工作2年半 我的翻译可能不对。自己看细节。 > "Deeming the possible loss of foreign grads with technical bachelor's degrees a serious threat to the U.S. requiring immediate action on its part, the Department of Homeland Security changed immigration rules without notice or comment Friday to allow foreign students to stay on to work in the States for two-and-a-half years after graduation without needing an H-1B visa." > [DHS Declares H-1B State Of Emergency; Allows Foreign Students To Stick Around Longer](http://techdirt.com/articles/20080407/110602777.shtml) 请看我给的文章的全文和DHS网站的[17-Month Extension of Optional Practical Training for Certain Highly Skilled Foreign Students](http://www.dhs.gov/xnews/releases/pr\_1207334008610.shtm)。别盲目乐观。持F-1签证的更要阅读全文！ 这是前因： ![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2227/2389314895\_42898c97ff\_o.jpg)
