unicef是联合国儿童基金会

## 名字缩写unicef

一般人不会从联合国儿童基金会的猜到unicef是些什么词的拼写。反正我是怎么都想不出来。因为United Nations Children's Fund，那i和e什么的是什么词啊。也曾猜测是是法语手字母缩写，但也想不出来。

知道我看到下面的描述，说unicef成立之初是二战后为国际鹅绒提供紧急基金的，所以，开始的名字是United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund，大体翻译就是“联合国国际儿童紧急基金会。后来成为联合国常设机构了，就改名为联合国儿童基金会。但开始名称的缩写还是保留下来了。


> The United Nations Children's Fund (or UNICEF) was created by the United Nations General Assembly on December 11, 1946, to provide emergency food and healthcare to children in countries that had been devastated by World War II. In 1953, UNICEF became a permanent part of the United Nations System and its name was shortened from the original United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund but it has continued to be known by the popular acronym based on this old name. Headquartered in New York City, UNICEF provides long-term humanitarian and developmental assistance to children and mothers in developing countries.

> 联合国儿童基金会（舊称聯合國國際兒童緊急救援基金會；United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund；简称UNICEF），1946年12月11日在联合国大会上成立。联合国儿童基金会的总部设在美國纽约，对发展中国家的母亲和孩子进行长期的人道主义和发展援助。作为一个志愿性的基金机构，联合国儿童基金会依靠政府和私人的捐助.他的项目着重于提高社区服务水平，以提高儿童的健康。联合国儿童基金会在1965年获得了诺贝尔和平奖。 在联合国儿童基金会执行主任Carol Bellamy到期以后，2005年5月由美国前农业部部长Ann Veneman担任执行主任，将加速新千年的发展目标提上了议事日程。
> 
> 联合国儿童基金会是促进建立一个实现儿童权利世界的主要推动力。联合国儿童基金会对全球决策者及基层各类合作伙伴的影响力可将一些富有创意的想法变为现实。这个特性使其有别于其他世界组织和从事儿童工作的组织。联合国儿童基金会相信抚养和关爱儿童是人类发展的基石。联合国儿童基金会就是为了实现这一目的而创立的—与其他机构协力克服贫困、暴力、疾病和歧视给儿童成长之路带来的障碍。联合国儿童基金会认为我们能够携手推进这一人道主义事业。

> 作为联合国主管儿童问题的机构，联合国儿童基金会在156个发展中和转型中国家开展工作，保障儿童的生存和发展。联合国儿童基金会是世界上最大的为贫穷国家提供疫苗的机构，为确保儿童的健康和达到营养标准，它通过为所有男女孩童提供高质量的基础教育、安全净水和卫生设施以及努力保护儿童免遭暴力、剥削和艾滋病的影响来推进千年发展目标的实现。

## unicef的亲善大使华人当选不少呢

国际亲善大使（international ambassadors)中华人当选的年份有：1994年黎明，20004年成龙，2007年郎朗。


## 我最喜欢的亲善大使还是Audrey Hepburn
另我印象最深刻也是我个人认为最有亲善能力和最能鼓舞人的就是1988年的奥黛丽·赫本，这个从小也是苦命的孩子。 Flag of Belgium Audrey Hepburn (appointed 1988, died 1993)

>  Work for UNICEF
>  
>  Soon after Hepburn's final film role, she was appointed a goodwill ambassador to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). Grateful for her own good fortune after enduring the German occupation as a child, she dedicated the remainder of her life to helping impoverished children in the poorest nations. Hepburn's travels were made easier by her wide knowledge of languages; she spoke French, Italian, English, Dutch, and Spanish.
>  
>  Though she had done work for UNICEF in the 1950s, starting in 1954 with radio presentations, this was a much higher level of dedication. Those close to her say that the thoughts of dying, helpless children consumed her for the rest of her life.

英文过关的朋友随着链接继续读。后面列举了不少赫本在各个国家帮助儿童的事情。

> 1988年至1993年间，赫本成为联合国儿童基金会的亲善大使，帮助拉美和非洲的孩子们，亲赴不少国家和地区，为孩子们呐喊、呼吁和募捐。为表彰她为全世界不幸儿童所做出的努力，美国电影艺术和科学学院将该1988年度奥斯卡人道奖授予了她。她的爱心与人格犹如她的影片一样灿烂人间。1993年，诺贝尔和平奖得主德蕾莎修女获悉奥黛丽·赫本病危的消息时，命令所有的修女彻夜为奥黛丽·赫本祷告祈使其能奇迹般地康复，祷告传遍世界各地。同年1月20日，赫本在瑞士托洛谢纳（Tolochenaz）的住所，因结肠癌病逝。

中文说她为联合国儿童基金会工作的部分很简单。

我为什么说她是苦命，而且为什么她很适合，也最认真地行使大使职责呢。因为她的童年。

> In 1939, her mother moved her and her two half-brothers to their grandfather's home in Arnhem in the Netherlands. Ella believed the Netherlands would be safe from German attack. Hepburn attended the Arnhem Conservatory from 1939 to 1945, where she trained in ballet along with the standard school curriculum.
> 
> In 1940, the Germans invaded the Netherlands. During the Nazi occupation, Hepburn adopted the pseudonym Edda van Heemstra, modifying her mother's documents because an 'English sounding' name was considered dangerous. This was never her legal name. The name Edda was a version of her mother's name Ella.[9]
> 
> By 1944, Hepburn had become a proficient ballerina. She secretly danced for groups of people to collect money for the Dutch resistance. She later said, "the best audience I ever had made not a single sound at the end of my performance."[10]
> 
> After the Allied landing on D-Day, living conditions grew worse. During the Dutch famine over the winter of 1944, the Germans confiscated the Dutch people's limited food and fuel supply for themselves. People starved and froze to death in the streets.
> 
> Hepburn and many others resorted to making flour out of tulip bulbs to bake cakes and biscuits.[5][11]
> 
> Arnhem was devastated by Allied artillery fire that was part of Operation Market Garden. Hepburn's uncle and her mother's cousin were shot in front of Hepburn for being part of the Resistance.
> 
> Hepburn's half-brother Ian van Ufford spent time in a German labour camp. Suffering from malnutrition, Hepburn developed acute anemia, respiratory problems, and oedema.[12]
> 
> In 1991, Hepburn said "I have memories. More than once I was at the station seeing trainloads of Jews being transported, seeing all these faces over the top of the wagon. I remember, very sharply, one little boy standing with his parents on the platform, very pale, very blond, wearing a coat that was much too big for him, and he stepped on to the train. I was a child observing a child."
> 
> Hepburn also noted the similarities between herself and Anne Frank: "I was exactly the same age as Anne Frank. We were both ten when war broke out and fifteen when the war finished. I was given the book in Dutch, in galley form, in 1946 by a friend. I read it – and it destroyed me. It does this to many people when they first read it but I was not reading it as a book, as printed pages. This was my life. I didn't know what I was going to read. I've never been the same again, it affected me so deeply."
> 
> "We saw reprisals. We saw young men put against the wall and shot and they'd close the street and then open it and you could pass by again. If you read the diary, I've marked one place where she says 'five hostages shot today'. That was the day my uncle was shot. And in this child's words I was reading about what was inside me and is still there. It was a catharsis for me. This child who was locked up in four walls had written a full report of everything I'd experienced and felt."
> 
> These times were not all bad and she was able to enjoy some of her childhood. Again drawing parallels to Anne Frank's life, Hepburn said "This spirit of survival is so strong in Anne Frank's words. One minute she says 'I
'm so depressed'. The next she is longing to ride a bicycle. She is certainly a symbol of the child in very difficult circumstances, which is what I devote all my time to. She transcends her death."
> 
> One way in which Audrey Hepburn passed the time was by drawing. Some of her childhood artwork can be seen today.[13]
> 
> When the country was liberated, United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration trucks followed.[14] Hepburn said in an interview she ate an entire can of condensed milk and then got sick from one of her first relief meals because she put too much sugar in her oatmeal.[15] This experience is what led her to become involved in UNICEF later in life.[5][11]
