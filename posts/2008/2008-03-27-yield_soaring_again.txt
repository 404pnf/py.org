> The Treasury stunned the market on Monday with the release of a gargantuan auction calendar totaling $136 billion raising $52 billion in new cash this week as US Government finances continued their headlong collapse. This was $30 billion more than the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee had estimated for this auction in its report issued January 31. The auctions included $20 billion in CMBs that were not on the TBAC’s radar at all just 7 weeks ago. That sent Treasury prices careening lower and yields soaring.
