kitchen island 是什么

an unattached counter in a kitchen that permits access from all sides
wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn

我理解是厨房中间一张桌子/台面。一般可以做餐桌也可以做切菜等用。看名字那么悬。而且我见过的一个是固定在餐厅/客厅中央的，四方行，很大，有个5－6平米，像吧台一样。

这个词有对应且比较顺口的中文翻译么？

可我看了看卖kitchen island的网站图片，发现我的理解有问题。它更像是活动或固定的厨房储物工作台。

> Kitchen Islands, often the hub of the kitchen, add precious counter space and storage capability. Available in many sizes, shapes and finishes, kitchen islands are not only practical, but are also attractive and provide a variety of features for organization and convenience. Choose islands with open or enclosed storage, drop leaves for expandable counter space or a breakfast bar for additional seating to accommodate your kitchen and lifestyle. Some kitchen islands are stationary for a secure workspace, while some islands come with casters so they can be moved easily when necessary. KitchenSource.com offers a wide selection of kitchen islands from Home Styles, John Boos, Catskill, Michael Scott, Winsome Wood and other manufacturers, so you can be sure you’ll find exactly what you need.
