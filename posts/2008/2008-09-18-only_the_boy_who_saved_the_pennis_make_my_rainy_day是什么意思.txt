# only the boy who saved the pennis make my rainy day是什么意思

only the boy who saved the pennis, make my rainy day是什么意思

这是modonna的歌词。歌名是material girl


pennies是penny的复数。penny是便士。在这里save the pennies是存钱的意思。开始我看错了，吓我一跳。

rainy day在俗语中有特别意思

> a (future) time of financial need; "I am saving for a rainy day"
> wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn
> 
> A difficult period of need, when things do not go right
> en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rainy day

就是说指缺钱的时候。

所以这句歌词是，“缺钱的时候，有存款的男孩才是我要的”。

我觉得80年代的modonna特别俗。点现在觉得这首曲子朗朗上口。歌词也足够刺激很多人的神经。但如果换个角度想，这首歌和当年madonna的形象都是为了大俗而露骨做为一种讽刺大俗和露骨，也说得通。
