Mr. C. J. de Jong of NSU-S and Mr. J. W. Matthijsen (retired) sent us the text of an English verse, written by a Dutch college professor (Charivarius). The Chaos may be considered a classic, at least among Dutchmen interested in the English language. Mr. De Jong came across the verse while in the U.K. during World War II. He served with the Netherlands merchant marine and for several years Liverpool was his home port."
