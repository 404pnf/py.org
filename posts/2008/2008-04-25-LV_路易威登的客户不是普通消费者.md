## LV，路易威登的客户不是普通消费者


> LV:
> 
> Our reporter contacted the Shanghai headquarters of LV.  The public relations person said that LV is one brand within the LVMH group, and asked the reporter to contact the French headquarters instead.  But the public relations person said that the Internet opinion should not impact the sales of LV products.  After all, LV is made for the upper-class echelon, whereas those netizens calling for the boycott are just ordinary consumers.
