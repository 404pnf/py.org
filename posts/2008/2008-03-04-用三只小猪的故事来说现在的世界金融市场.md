>有相當多的版本，下列為其中一個版本。

>三隻小豬是兄弟，為抵抗大野狼而有不同的遭遇，大哥蓋草屋，二哥蓋木屋，三弟蓋了磚屋，最後只有不嫌麻煩的三弟的屋子沒有被大野狼弄垮，還把大野狼給煮來吃了。

我们来改编一下这个故事。这个故事是 http://karmabanquradio.com 的max keiser讲的。我很喜欢。新版本是这样，生动地反映了现在的金融市场。房子在这里就是保护自己的财产的比喻。

> 第一只小猪用morgage建自己的房子，就是一些CDOs（collateralised  debts obligations）。第二只小猪用monolized insurance建自己的房子。这些monolized insurace就是去保险那些CDO的。第三只小猪用bond建自己的房子。而债券是支持和“保险”那些monolized insurance的。

连锁反应下来。三只小猪全部死翘翘。别以为债券保险。因为债券被用来保monolized insurance, monoliaze insurance是去保CDO，CDO是废纸。

这个故事太生动了。

下面是wikipedia上three little pigs的故事

https://tor-proxy.net/cgi-bin/enc/nph-proxy_jap.cgi/111110A/687474703a2f2f656e2e77696b6970656469612e6f72672f77696b692f54687265655f4c6974746c655f50696773

Three Little pigs is a fairy tale featuring talking animals. Published versions of the story date back to the late 18th century, but the story is thought to be much older. In 1933, Walt Disney made an animated cartoon based on the tale.

The phrases used in this story, and the various morals that can be drawn from it, have become enshrined in western culture. In recent years, the story, as has happened to other fairy tales, frequently is softened from its original version. In these versions, neither the wolf or the pigs end up eating each other. For instance, the two less prudent pigs escape to the house of the third pig while the wolf is captured rather than boiled.

Plot

Mother Pig sends her three little piglets out into the world to make the strongest house for the family but they get into a fight so they all make three different houses.

The first little pig builds a house of straw, but a wolf blows it down and eats the pig. The encounter between wolf and pig features ringing proverbial phrases:

One day the big bad wolf came and knocked on the first little pig's door and said, "Little pig, little pig, let me come in." And the little pig answered, "No, no, I won't let you come in, not by the hair on my chinny chin chin." "Well," said the wolf, "then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in." So he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down and swallowed the first pig.

The second pig builds a house of sticks, has the same conversation with the wolf, and the wolf swallows the second pig.

The third pig builds a house of brick. The wolf cannot huff and puff hard enough to blow the house down. He attempts to trick the third little pig out of his house, but the pig outsmarts him at every turn. Finally, the wolf threatens to come down the chimney, whereupon the third little pig boils a pot of water into which the wolf plunges.
