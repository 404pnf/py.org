> I work at a public library. We often have patrons who want to know what they have taken out in the past so they can recommend the book to a friend or some such thing. However, we cannot tell them because we delete the record once the item is returned and all fines (if any) are paid. At first they are miffed but, when we explain we do this automatically to protect their privacy, they are mollified if not pleased. That is because they expect the library to protect their privacy. The same goes with our public computers.

这里告诉大家，因为我曾经了解过国内网络服务的法律规定，国内的服务器必须保留前几个月或是半年（？我忘了）的log文件，就是保留谁（ip）在何时访问了什么。

我这台服务器不再中国内地。

其实我记录这个是想如果我今后开公司，搞网站服务，有时难免需要知道一些客户个人信息。应该采取用完了立刻销毁。否则，总有可能丢失或者被要求交出等，反而让自己公司运营上增加成本和法律风险：比如你丢失客户个人信息是可能需要赔偿和受到惩罚的。
