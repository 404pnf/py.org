## IceCat是GNU计划下基于firefox但不是firefox的程序

> Origin of the name
> 
> The name “IceCat” was coined to show our relation with the Mozilla Firefox browser. Ice isn't Fire and a Cat isn't a Fox, so it is clearly a different package (we don't want Mozilla blamed for our mistakes, nor cause confusion with their trademarks), but is equally clearly intimately related (of course nearly all of the work comes from the Mozilla foundation effort, so we want to give credit).
> 
> The gNewSense BurningDog browser and the Debian IceWeasel browser are similarly derived from Firefox, also with the intent of being free software. Technically, however, these projects are maintained entirely independently of IceCat. (Previously, this GNU browser project was also named IceWeasel, but that proved confusing.)

我还是喜欢名字。好玩的名字。这里的对仗是，ice对fire，cat对fox。区别足够明显。和debian计划中的ice对fire，weasel对fox又有所区别（我上次写自由软件中有趣名字时举得例子就是iceweesel，当时gnu的这个浏览器也叫iceweasel。）BurninDog听着有些别扭。但burning对fire，dog对fox？应该burning对ice，dog对cat吧。：）
