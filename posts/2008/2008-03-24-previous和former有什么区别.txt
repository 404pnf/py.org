## previous和former有什么区别

一个朋友问我。我说基本没区别，我建议她用previous指“上一届活动”。

看到一篇论坛文章[说了previous和former的区别](http://forum.wordreference.com/showthread.php?t=59418)


> Hello, Arageme, and welcome to the forums.

也说基本没区别。

> Former means "was", or "of the past", and does not imply that it will be again. Yet it does not exclude the qualites nor possibility.
> Previous simply means "before", as in a series.

说了有不明显的区别。
