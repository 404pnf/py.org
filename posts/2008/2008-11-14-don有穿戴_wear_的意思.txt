# don有穿戴 wear 的意思

don有穿戴（wear）的意思 > wear: put clothing on one's body; "What should I wear today?"; "He put on his best suit for the wedding"; "The princess donned a long blue dress"; "The queen assumed the stately robes"; "He got into his jeans" 这个解释排在最后看来不是很常用。但我今天还是看见了。所以记录一下。一般出现在上下文中，做穿戴讲是肯定能猜到的。比如我今天看到的是： “I would have donned my best tie to see you.” > + a Spanish gentleman or nobleman > + preceptor: teacher at a university or college (especially at Cambridge or Oxford) > + the head of an organized crime family > + Celtic goddess; mother of Gwydion and Arianrhod; corresponds to Irish Danu > + a European river in southwestern Russia; flows into the Sea of Azov > + a Spanish courtesy title or form of address for men that is prefixed to the forename; "Don Roberto" > + wear: put clothing on one's body; "What should I wear today?"; "He put on his best suit for the wedding"; "The princess donned a long blue dress"; "The queen assumed the stately robes"; "He got into his jeans" > wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn
