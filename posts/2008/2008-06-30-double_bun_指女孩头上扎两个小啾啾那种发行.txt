They can either be secured with a hairpiece, a hairnet and bobby pins. They may be tightly gathered or slightly messier and more informal. Buns, like ponytails, may cause headaches if worn too tight or up too high on the head. ![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Hair\_in\_bun.JPG/180px-Hair\_in\_bun.JPG) ## Chignon (hairstyle) > From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia > > A chignon, pronounced "sheen-yon,” is a popular type of bun style. The word “chignon” comes from the French phrase “chignon du cou,” which means nape of the neck. Chignons are generally achieved by pinning the hair into a knot at the nape of the neck, but there are many different variations of the style. They are frequently worn for special occasions, like weddings and formal dances, but the basic chignon is also worn for everyday casual wear.
