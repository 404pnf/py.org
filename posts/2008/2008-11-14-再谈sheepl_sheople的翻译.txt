> Sheeple is a term of disparagement, a portmanteau created by combining the words "sheep" and "people."
> 
> It is often used to denote persons who acquiesce to authority, and thus undermine their own human individuality. The implication of sheeple is that as a collective, people believe whatever they are told, especially if told so by authority figures, without processing it to be sure that it is an accurate representation of the real world around them. The term is generally used in a political or religious sense. The singular form of the term is "sherson;" however, the plural form is most often used.
