It's posting in a way that's intended to deceive the reader into thinking the message is by an average citizen and not paid propaganda. It's fraud. > > Astroturfers are lying scum and should be in jail. > > Companies should have no right of anonymity and it's about time the law caught up with them.

Astroturfers attempt to orchestrate the actions of apparently diverse and geographically distributed individuals, by both overt ("outreach", "awareness", etc.) and covert (disinformation) means. Astroturfing may be undertaken by anything from an individual pushing one's own personal agenda through to highly organized professional groups with financial backing from large corporations, non-profits, or activist organizations. > > [Astroturfing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing) 相应中文翻译成什么好？伪民间、伪公民（平民）？
