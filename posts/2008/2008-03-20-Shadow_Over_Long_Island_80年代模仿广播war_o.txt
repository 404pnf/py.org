# Shadow Over Long Island 80年代模仿广播war of worlds的广播剧

## Shadow Over Long Island > http://www.2600.com/radio/shadow/ > This play is a real time production which follows the tradition of the "War of the Worlds" broadcast many years ago in which a somewhat believable scenario is presented to the public, leaving many to wonder whether or not they're listening to reality or to fiction. In this case, "Shadow Over Long Island" deals with an accident at a nuclear power plant on Long Island and the resulting chaos that ensues. At the time of the original broadcast in 1985, nuclear safety was a very controversial topic in the area as a plant was set to open in the vicinity. Since then the plant has been shut down after widespread public opposition. This radio play was written by Emmanuel Goldstein/Eric Corley in the height of the controversy and has been broadcast on a number of occasions on Long Island and Connecticut radio stations. 在上面的链接可以在线收听或者下载节目。 当年war of worlds播出的时候，因为那时似乎没有电视，有也非常少。大家都听广播。有些人以为是真事呢。一片恐慌。我记得小时候看war of world说的漫画，挺喜欢的。现在唯一记得的就是攻击地球的外形机器人都是腿很长，上面一个蚌壳一样的身子。
