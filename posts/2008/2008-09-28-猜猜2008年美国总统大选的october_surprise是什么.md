# 猜猜2008年美国总统大选的october surprise是什么



和lvcha聊天说道了october suprise，这里介绍一下。

> October surprise
> 
> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
> An October surprise is American political jargon describing a news event with the potential to influence the outcome of an election, particularly one for the presidency. It is so called because the presidential elections are held in early November, and therefore events that take place in October have greater potential to swing votes. "Historically, news outlets avoid investigative pieces critical of candidates within days of an election to avoid appearing partisan." [1] Particularly since the 1980 election, the term has been pre-emptively used to discredit late-campaign news by one side or the other.
> 
> The term usually applies to the acts of a sitting president, especially in military or foreign policy matters. But it can also apply to news stories unfavorable to the incumbent administration.

大家可以去wikipedia上看全文，历届都出现过什么“十月难料的事”

我今年的猜想：

+ 经济崩溃
+ 打伊朗
+ 抓住拉登
+ 拉登发表录像称要搞美国


这些都足以影响选举结果，但我更愿意赌的是今年选举会举推迟。所以我更多的是同一october suprise conspiracy这一派。：）

经济已经崩溃了。美国的。上周美国已经结束了其资本主义国家的历程，正是进入苏联主义或者封建主义。

大家都一路走好。：）
