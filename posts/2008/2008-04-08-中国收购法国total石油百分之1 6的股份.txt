中国收购法国total石油百分之1 6的股份

## 中国收购法国total石油百分之1.6的股份 还是石油方面的消息，[China buys 1.6% stake in Total](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/8a6a78a2-0179-11dd-a323-000077b07658,dwp\_uuid=5b566934-3013-11da-ba9f-00000e2511c8,print=yes.html)。total是第四大石油集团。 > The body that manages the bulk of China’s $1,650bn in foreign exchange reserves has bought a 1.6 per cent stake in France’s Total, the fourth-largest oil group, in a sign of its more aggressive approach to investing the funds under its control. > > China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or Safe, which operates under China’s central bank, began building its stake, valued at €1.8bn ($2.8bn), several months ago, according to a person close to the company. > > It is understood that this has been done with the full knowledge of the oil company and representatives of Safe are likely to have met Total’s team, the person said. 不过这么说是不准确的。因为真正的石油大户不是石油公司，而是国有石油企业。比如沙特、比如委内瑞拉、比如俄罗斯、比如中国。私有公司现在生产份额占的不多。搞定国有的，才有出路。 哈哈。我又开始瞎说石油了。 说句不好听的，国家外汇管理局（China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or Safe, which operates under China’s central bank, began building its stake）拿着10几亿美元在“欧洲打来打去（找投资机会），也不让我们听个响（给群众们汇报一下啊），这也不好啊。”这段是想模仿王朔在一篇文章里写的一句话。
