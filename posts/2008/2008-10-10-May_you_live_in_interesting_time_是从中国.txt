# May you live in interesting time 是从中国谚语来的

"May you live in interesting time"是从中国谚语来的？ ## 这是什么中国谚语啊？May you live in interesting time 想不出来。 每次听有人说总是提这是一句中国谚语。美国人喜欢用。 我搜索了一下[中国谚语 may we live in interesting time](http://www.google.cn/search?complete=1&hl=zh-CN&newwindow=1&sa=X&oi=spell&resnum=0&ct=result&cd=1&q=%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E8%B0%9A%E8%AF%AD+may+we+live+in+interesting+time&spell=1) ## 说它不是中国谚语的 > 青衣青石青丝 > 2007-06-12, 15:56 > 看看下面这篇文章，昏倒。。。。。。 不是中国谚语。。。。。。:D > > > May You Live in Interesting Times? > by Dr. Ho Yong > > Have you ever heard of the proverb, "May you live in interesting times"? Were you told it was a Chinese proverb? You may be surprised when you read Dr. Ho Yong's answer to this question in response to a question from the PBS show, "Newshour with Jim Lehrer." > > I recently received a request from the PBS television show, "Newshour with Jim Lehrer," to verify the original source of the Chinese proverb, "May you live in interesting times." Newshour was told that in this context, "interesting" means dangerous or turbulent; therefore, the whole phrase is something of a curse. However, I couldn't think of any Chinese proverb that says anything to that effect. > > So I consulted Torrey Whitman, our President (President of the China Institute in New York City), who is versed in classical Chinese and is especially knowledgeable in the area of proverbs and sayings. Interestingly enough, he told me he was familiar with this saying. Thus, I happily turned this request over to Torrey. The following is what he wrote about his response to the Jim Lehrer show: > > "I explained to the news show staff that the usual expression was, "The ancient Chinese curse, May you live in interesting times." There is nothing proverbial about it, and no harm or danger is intended to the recipient of the curse. > > The point of the phrase has long been meant to be ironic: on first glance, "interesting times" should be good times to live in, so stating it as a curse adds the sense of irony. We live in very interesting times, but after reading in the newspaper about tragedies, politics, war-mongering, and so on, have you longed for simpler, less turbulent times? Think how difficult and frustrating it is to choose among the twenty varieties of coffee now offered at the corner coffee stand, or the 138 channels on cable TV. Hence, the "curse" that you live in "interesting" times. > > But what is most noteworthy about the expression is that it is not Chinese. There is no such expression, "May you live in interesting times," in Chinese. It is a non-Chinese creation, most probably American, that has been around for at least 30 or 40 years. It appears in book prefaces, newspapers (frequently in the New York Times) and speeches, as an eye- or ear-catcher, although I have not found it in Bartlett's Quotations or other quotation sourcebooks. I speculate that whoever it was who first coined it attempted to give the expression a mystique, and so decided to attribute it to the Chinese. > > There is an irony in this, too. Confucius, endeavoring to give his opinions and teachings greater gravity and acceptance, once stated, "I do not create; I merely pass on the wisdom of those who have gone before." The same device of attribution is at work here: the "curse of interesting times" is much more interesting itself if the Chinese created it." > > 来源： http://www.honglm.net/bbs/archive/index.php/t-28054.html ## 说是中国谚语的 宁为太平狗，不做乱世人 没办法--这句话最早就是从中国古代俗话这样翻译出来的 但是现在居然会变成祝词~~~ 出自：Robert F Kennedy翻译的：明·冯梦龙《醒世恒言》第三卷： “却说莘善领着浑家阮氏和十二岁的女儿，同一般逃难的，背着包裹，结队而走。忙忙如丧家之犬，急急如漏网之鱼。担饥担冻担劳苦，此行谁是家乡？叫天叫地叫祖宗，惟愿不逢鞑虏！正是： 宁为太平犬，莫作乱离人！ ” 同书第十九卷： “〔程万里〕每日间见元兵所过，残灭如秋风扫叶，心中暗暗悲痛，正是：宁为太平犬，莫作离乱人。” 另有人说是‘难得糊涂’我看第一种可能性比较大 参考资料：http://zhidao.baidu.com/question/25249163.html?fr=qrl3 回答者： Meinteil - 护军统领 十二级 11-29 13:50 来源： http://zhidao.baidu.com/question/40581845.html ## 我认为它不是中国谚语。至少上面给的翻译放在语境中讲不通。 第一个解释看着比较权威的。而且说道了它在英文中使用的时候隐含的意思是什么。从我听到语境中也都是前景不明朗、而且很不乐观的时候采用。 翻译成“宁为太平狗，不做乱世人”和“难的糊涂”放到英文语境中都讲不通。 ## 看看wikipedia上怎么说 [在wikipedia的文本中搜索这句话](http://www.google.cn/search?hl=zh-CN&q=May+you+live+in+interesting+times+site%3Awikipedia.org&btnG=Google+%E6%90%9C%E7%B4%A2&meta=&aq=f&oq=) 这句话有自己的条目。 > May you live in interesting times > From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia > Jump to: navigation, search > This article or section may contain original research or unverified claims. > Please improve the article by adding references.

It is reported[who?] that it was the first of three curses of increasing severity, the other two being: > > \* May you come to the attention of those in authority > \* May you find what you are looking for > > [edit] Origins > > One possibility is that the above phrase is from the following Chinese saying "时势造英雄"(pin-yin:shi shi zao ying xiong), which means heroes(leaders) are made over turbulent times. > > No known user of the English phrase has supplied the purported Chinese language original, and the Chinese language origin of the phrase, if it exists, has not been found, making its authenticity doubtful. One theory is that it may be related to the Chinese proverb, "It's better to be a dog in a peaceful time than be a man in a chaotic period" (寧為太平犬，不做亂世人; pinyin: níng wéi tàipíng quǎn, bù zuò luànshì rén).[citation needed] > > The saying has also been attributed to the fictional Chinese storyteller Kai Lung invented by the Edwardian, English author Ernest Bramah, though this too has yet to be documented.[1] > > The Yale Book of Quotations gives a citation for the phrase “May you live in interesting times” as follows “American Society of International Law Proceedings vol. 33 (1939).” The Yale Book of Quotations also states that “No authentic Chinese saying to this effect has ever been found.” [2] > > Evidence that a slight variant of the phrase was in use “many years” before 1936 is provided by an attestation from 1939. Frederic R. Coudert, a Trustee of Columbia University, presented opening remarks at a meeting of the “Academy of Political Science” in 1939. In his remarks the phrase “May you live in an interesting age” is labeled a Chinese curse. Coudert cites a letter from Austen Chamberlain, half-brother of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, for introducing him to the curse. He also says that Chamberlain learned about the curse from a British diplomat in China:[3] > Some years ago, in 1936, I had to write to a very dear and honored friend of mine, who has since died, Sir Austen Chamberlain, brother of the present Prime Minister, and I concluded my letter with a rather banal remark, "that we were living in an interesting age." Evidently he read the whole letter, because by return mail he wrote to me and concluded as follows: "Many years ago, I learned from one of our diplomats in China that one of the principal Chinese curses heaped upon an enemy is, 'May you live in an interesting age.'" "Surely", he said, "no age has been more fraught with insecurity than our own present time." That was three years ago. > > — Frederic R. Coudert, Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science, 1939 > > Another piece of evidence that the phrase was in use as early as 1936 is provided by a memoir written by Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen who was the British Ambassador to China in 1936 and 1937. The memoir describes an instance of a friend of Knatchbull-Hugessen using the phrase:[4] > Before I left England for China in 1936 a friend told me that there exists a Chinese curse — "May you live in interesting times". If so, our generation has certainly witnessed that curse's fulfilment. > > — Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, Diplomat in Peace and War, 1949 > > Since the memoir was published in 1949 the chronological evidence it gives is indirect. The accuracy of the 1936 date depends on the precision of Knatchbull-Hugessen’s memory. But the quote is consistent with the timeline of his Ambassadorial service in China. The text of the book is searchable via Google Book Search. > > Another use of the phrase occurred in 1950, when the April issue of Astounding Science Fiction included the saying in one of the magazine's stories. The story was penned by Eric Frank Russell under the name Duncan H. Munro. > > [edit] Popularizing and usage > > The saying was used by Robert F. Kennedy in his Day of Affirmation Address in Cape Town, South Africa, in 1966. It was quoted in the TV shows Magnum, P.I. and Star Trek: Voyager, was part of a speech delivered by the character Bob Garvin (Donald Sutherland) near the end of the 1994 film Disclosure, and also appears in Dean Koontz's 1996 novel Tick Tock. > > The saying is referenced in the title and text of Terry Pratchett's 1994 Discworld novel Interesting Times. The same title is used for the autobiography of the historian Eric Hobsbawm, and for writer George Packer's New Yorker blog[5] (which focuses on the Iraq war and other political issues). > > source: 还是wikipedia解释的清楚。看来多数人在使用时确实认为它是中国谚语，而且还是一种诅咒呢（curse）。但我读完全文还是没找到这话来自什么中国谚语经典。倒是中国人喜欢说反话。这要看语境。比如北京话“一路走好啊你哪”。看什么语气。可能是嘱咐你，声调不对了就是说反话了。我更愿意相信这话其实就是一种反着说的意思。这样理解就简单多了。 还有一个用户的页面上也给出了自己的解释 > May you live in interesting times. - In seems to be a Chinese curse. The reasoning is the following: quiet times are the best, as everything is peaceful and safe. Interesting times are dangerous, stressful, of conflict, and destruction. Still I would like to live in interesting times because truth be told these are also times of change and tremendous progress (technological, political, but also social, etc). As I grow older and wiser (?) I may change my mind. > > source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Flamarande
