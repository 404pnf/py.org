tabbar > File: emacs-goodies-el, Node: tabbar, Next: table, Prev: sys-apropos, Up: Top > > 70 tabbar - Display a tab bar in the header line > > Author: David Ponce > > This library provides the Tabbar global minor mode to display a tab > bar in the header line of Emacs 21 and later versions. You can use the > mouse to click on a tab and select it. Also, three buttons are > displayed on the left side of the tab bar in this order: the "home", > "scroll left", and "scroll right" buttons. The "home" button is a > general purpose button used to change something on the tab bar. The > scroll left and scroll right buttons are used to scroll tabs > horizontally. Tabs can be divided up into groups to maintain several > sets of tabs at the same time (see also the chapter "Core" below for > more details on tab grouping). Only one group is displayed on the tab > bar, and the "home" button, for example, can be used to navigate > through the different groups, to show different tab bars. > > In a graphic environment, using the mouse is probably the preferred > way to work with the tab bar. However, you can also use the tab bar > when Emacs is running on a terminal, so it is possible to use commands > to press special buttons, or to navigate cyclically through tabs. > > These commands, and default keyboard shortcuts, are provided: > > `tabbar-mode' Toggle the Tabbar global minor mode. When enabled a > tab bar is displayed in the header line. > > `tabbar-local-mode' Toggle the Tabbar-Local minor mode. > Provided the global minor mode is turned on, the tab bar becomes local > in the current buffer when the local minor mode is enabled. This > permits to see the tab bar in a buffer where the header line is already > used by another mode (like `Info-mode' for example). > > `tabbar-mwheel-mode' Toggle the Tabbar-Mwheel global minor mode. > When enabled you can use the mouse wheel to navigate through tabs of > groups. > > `tabbar-press-home' > > `tabbar-press-scroll-left' > > `tabbar-press-scroll-right' Simulate a mouse-1 click on > respectively the "home", "scroll left", and "scroll right" buttons. A > numeric prefix argument value of 2, or 3, respectively simulates a > mouse-2, or mouse-3 click. > > `tabbar-backward' > > `tabbar-forward' are the basic commands to navigate > cyclically through tabs or groups of tabs. The cycle is controlled by > the `tabbar-cycle-scope' option. The default is to navigate through > all tabs across all existing groups of tabs. You can change the > default behavior to navigate only through the tabs visible on the tab > bar, or through groups of tabs only. Or use the more specialized > commands below. > > `tabbar-backward-tab' `tabbar-forward-tab' Navigate through the tabs > visible on the tab bar. > > `tabbar-backward-group' > > `tabbar-forward-group' Navigate through > existing groups of tabs.
