1998年long term capital management的那些事儿！ 需要补课的看看[google搜索long term capital management的结果](http://www.google.com/search?q=long+term+capital+management) 记得98年long term capital management的经济事件么。当年大银行和金融机构说好了帮忙。因为都是道上混的，一家出了事情，必然暴露更多问题。黑社会有时候也抱团，因为利益一致啊。 bears sterns当年没有帮忙。wall street的银行等了10年，今年上半年给bear sterns进行了安乐死（http://karmabanqueradio.com的max keisser入木三分的评论。）。 > 1998 Bailout > > Goldman Sachs, AIG and Berkshire Hathaway offered then to buy out the fund's partners for $250 million, to inject $3.75 billion and to operate LTCM within Goldman Sachs's own trading.
