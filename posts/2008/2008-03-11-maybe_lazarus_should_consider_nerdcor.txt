I love nerdcore. Because, I LEARNED! :) I downloaded about 5-6 albums, some are good. The one I like the most, unfortunately not included in any of the albums, is the intro of ..., god i forgot the name of that podcast, oh, i will fill in that later. They were on Hope Number Six, doing a live show.


Yes, the show is [Binary Revolution](http://www.binrev.com/), binrev in short! That show rocks!
