今天才真正知道了ftp.funet.fi到芬兰教育部办的

这个站点太有名了。对于我来说啊。：）97年左右去得很多。后来也经常看到这个url。

当让你可以通过http访问： http://www.nic.funet.fi

另外一个非常重要的从站点，至少在90年代，是 ftp://ftp.sunet.se/ 。

2个都是北欧的！

> This is a Fujitsu-Siemens 450 server with four SPARC64 V processors,
> 16GB of memory and a fault tolerant EMC FibreCat CX300 fibre channel
> RAID storage subsystem configured with 15 x 300GB Fibre Channel disks
> and 15 x 500GB SATA disks. Even though somebody might add up it as a

> Operating system is Solaris 10 Unix from Sun Microsystems. We have a
