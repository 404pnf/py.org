# TV-B-Gone 让身边干扰你的电视都关上

TV-B-Gone：让身边干扰你的电视都关上！！！这个设备会发出关闭电视的红外信号，而且针对是很多品牌的关闭信号，所以即使商店里、电梯里和街上播放广告的电视牌子不同也不要紧。

多希望有一个，在进入公共汽车和地铁后，关掉车上的电视！！比较好的玩儿发是戴个帽子，把这玩意儿藏在帽子里。

> TV-B-Gone is a type of simple but universal remote control device for turning off television sets, developed and sold by Mitch Altman. The device was designed to be able to turn off a large majority of the current available brands of television sets. It was created to allow people in a public place to turn off nearby television sets, presumably because the broadcast was distracting them from other activities. Its inventor has referred to it as "an environmental management device". The device is part of a key-chain, and, like other remote devices, is battery-powered. Although it can require up to 69 seconds for the device to find the proper code for a particular television, the most popular TVs turn off in the first few seconds.

在香港坐地铁的时间，发现他们车站都有指示告诉你“安静车厢”是第4节车厢。我开始没明白。后来专门看了一下，是第4节车厢内也有电视，放广告和一些消息，但电视是静音的，所以，至少你不看电视屏幕就不干扰你。

当今社会，大家买了车票坐车，还需要到专门车厢才能不受广告干扰啊！！那干脆弄些车厢到处广告，车票免费吧！！
