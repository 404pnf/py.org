我从精神状态上是一个 求生主义者 survivalist

所以会对alex jones一类的节目感兴趣。他的广告商都是针对生存主义者的，比如，可以存储5年的食品之类～！ ：） 同样，我们这些人也偏爱黄金。哈哈。我也许不是。但今天听karmabanqueradio说道alex jones的听众群可以从广告商看出到底是什么人。就像jim kramer之类的财经节目，广告上都是银行，你就知道绝大部分财经评论员都是帮银行卖股票的人。 > Survivalism > From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia > > Survivalism is a commonly used term for the 18preparedness strategy and subculture of individuals or groups anticipating and making preparations for future possible disruptions in local, regional or worldwide social or political order. Survivalists often prepare for this anticipated disruption by learning skills (e.g., emergency medical training), stockpiling food and water, preparing for self-defense and 19self-sufficiency, and/or building structures that will help them to survive or "disappear" (e.g., a 20survival retreat or 21underground shelter). > > The specific preparations made by survivalists depend on the nature of the anticipated disruption(s), some of the most common scenarios being: > > + 22Natural disaster clusters, and patterns of apocalyptic planetary crises or 23Earth changes, such as 24Climate Change bringing on 25tornadoes, 26hurricanes, 27earthquakes, 28blizzards, and severe 29thunderstorms, etc. > + A disaster brought about by the activities of mankind: 30chemical spills, release of 31radioactive materials, 32war, or an oppressive government. > + General collapse of society, resulting from the unavailability of electricity, fuel, food, and water. > + Monetary disruption or 33economic collapse, stemming from monetary manipulation, 34hyperinflation or worldwide depression. > + Widespread chaos, or some other unexplained 35apocalyptic event. > > Within pop-culture, especially in the United States, the term is also used to refer to isolationist groups, often with anti-government agendas. Pop-culture survivalism is often associated with paramilitary activity, though real world survivalism rarely includes such activities. > >
