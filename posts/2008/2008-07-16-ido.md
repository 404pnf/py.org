>    As you type in a substring, the list of buffers or files currently
> matching the substring are displayed as you type.  The list is ordered
> so that the most recent buffers or files visited come at the start of
> the list.
> 
>    The buffer or file at the start of the list will be the one visited
> when you press return.  By typing more of the substring, the list is
> narrowed down so that gradually the buffer or file you want will be at
> the top of the list.  Alternatively, you can use <C-s> and <C-r> (or the
> right and left arrow keys) to rotate buffer or file names in the list
> until the one you want is at the top of the list.  Completion is also
> available so that you can see what is common to all of the matching
> buffers or files as you type.
