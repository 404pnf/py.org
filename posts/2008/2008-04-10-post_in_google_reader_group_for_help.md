## post in google reader group for help

更新：本文问题已解决。请参考[这里](http://pengyou.rijiben.org/node/2063)。


Follow the unoffical google reader api http://code.google.com/p/pyrfeed/wiki/GoogleReaderAPI

i construct a url

     https://www.google.com/reader/atom/user/-/state/com.google/starred

Yes, it gives  me a xml file, containing latest 20 starred itmes. The
xml file can be view in source code form in firefox. I assume this is
th atom url for my starred itmes. But, I can subscribe the feed via
thunderbird.

I have 2 questions:

1. How do I subscribe to my starred items feed in thunderbird.

2. In the unofficial google reader api, there's a n paremeter which
specify how many items on can get from a feed, the default value is
20. Say, I want to list 100 starred itmes in that feed. How to do
that? I just append an n=100 at the end of above-mentioned url, it
seems to work.
