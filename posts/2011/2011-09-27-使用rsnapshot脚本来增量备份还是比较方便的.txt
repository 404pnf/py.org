# 使用rsnapshot脚本来增量备份还是比较方便的

http://rsnapshot.org/howto/1.2/rsnapshot-HOWTO.en.html rsnapshot configtest 测试一下配置文件 The final step to test your configuration is to run rsnapshot in test mode. This will print out a verbose list of the things it will do, without actually doing them. To do a test run, run this command: rsnapshot -t hourly Remember that if you are using different intervals than the ones in this example, the first interval listed is the one that gets updates directly from the main filesystem. All subsequently listed intervals pull from the previous intervals. For example, if you had weekly, monthly, and yearly intervals defined (in that order), the weekly ones would get updated directly from the filesystem, the monthly ones would get updated from weekly, and the yearly ones would get updated from monthly.
