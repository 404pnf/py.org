直接从ubuntu server 8 04 升级到 10 04

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LucidUpgrades Network Upgrade for Ubuntu Servers (Recommended) Ensure you're up to date with latest release: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade Install update-manager-core if it is not already installed: sudo apt-get install update-manager-core edit /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades and set Prompt=lts Note: The minumum contents of /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades should be [DEFAULT] Prompt=lts Launch the upgrade tool: sudo do-release-upgrade Follow the on-screen instructions. At the end of the upgrade process you will be required to restart the server in order to boot into the new kernel. If you do not have access to the console of the system you are upgrading, you may need to edit /boot/grub/menu.lst and change the default boot kernel to the newly installed 10.04 kernel. If this step is not performed your server may attempt to boot into the 8.04 LTS kernel and will hang. http://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=ubuntu+server+9.10+mysql+cant+start+security+audit&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8#hl=en&expIds=25657,27026,27031,27032,27035,27036,27042,27642&sugexp=ldymls&xhr=t&q=ubuntu+server+9.10+mysql+failed+after+upgrade&cp=50&qe=dWJ1bnR1IHNlcnZlciA5LjEwIG15c3FsIGZhaWxlZCBhZnRlciB1cGdyYWRl&qesig=W4Pzo9EUXZwUQVOr4BgZ8w&pkc=AFgZ2tmltXHEgbIVI6PDi\_YNYe5pVyzl8qmwLmGFeQdz00RLvVJUBA0MPM1tbe1dwU0T\_ud-PK5Y2Di7-MmQztfDwzsfb9hLQg&pf=p&sclient=psy&newwindow=1&source=hp&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=ubuntu+server+9.10+mysql+failed+after+upgrade&gs\_rfai=&pbx=1&fp=9111c1d610a8252
