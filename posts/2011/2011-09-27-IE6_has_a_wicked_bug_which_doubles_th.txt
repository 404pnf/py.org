# IE6 has a wicked bug which doubles the margin on any floated elements


> IE6 has a wicked bug which doubles the margin on any floated elements. This could be a huge problem, but is easily fixed by adding display: inline to that which is floated. This causes no side-effects in any other browsers, so it simply lives in the main 960.css file.
