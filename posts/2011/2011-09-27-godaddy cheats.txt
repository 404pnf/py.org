godaddy cheats

[tags] godaddy,为您服务 [/tags] godaddy sets Auto Renew: of each domain resgistered default to ON. So i was billed for 3 domain that i didn't intentd to keep. I was getting the email remainder about these domains are about to expire and godaddy urged me to renew them. I didn't bother to log in the check since I ASSUME (AS EVERYBODY) that godday can't charge my credit card without my consent. BUT THEY DO. AND WITH YOUR CONSENT TECHNICALLY (REALLY TECHNICALLY)! GODADDY SUCKS!
