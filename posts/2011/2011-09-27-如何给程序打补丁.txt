# 如何给程序打补丁


## 打补丁
> http://drupal.org/patch/apply
> Provided that the patch was made relative to the root directory of the concerned project, navigate to the that directory (using cd). For a patch on Drupal, that will be the Drupal directory; for a contrib module or theme, that is the root directory of the project. Once there, issue the command:
> patch -p0 < path/file.patch
> If the patch was not made relative to the project's root directory, you can place the patch in the same directory as the file being patched and run the patch command without the -p option. To do so, cd to the directory and type:
> 
>       patch < file.patch

> You can reverse a patch if you have finished testing it, or if you want to see whether a problem has been introduced by a particular patch. You should also reverse a patch prior to adding a newer, updated version of the same patch. To reverse the patch, use the patch command with the -R option:
>       patch -p0 -R < path/file.patch
