# find 和 xargs使用

[tags] bash,find [/tags]
EXAMPLES
       find /tmp -name core -type f -print | xargs /bin/rm -f

       Find  files  named core in or below the directory /tmp and delete them.  Note that this will work incor-
       rectly if there are any filenames containing newlines, single or double quotes, or spaces.

       find /tmp -name core -type f -print0 | xargs -0 /bin/rm -f

       Find files named core in or below the directory /tmp and delete them, processing filenames in such a way
       that  file  or directory names containing single or double quotes, spaces or newlines are correctly han-
       dled.  The -name test comes before the -type test in order to avoid having  to  call  stat(2)  on  every
       file.

       find . -type f -exec file '{}' \;
