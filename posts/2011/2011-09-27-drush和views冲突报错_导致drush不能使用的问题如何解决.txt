# drush和views冲突报错 导致drush不能使用的问题如何解决



参考： http://drupal.org/node/1148932


After installing latest 7.x-3.x-dev (06 May 2011), drush stopped working with following errors:
Fatal error: Cannot redeclare views_revert_views() (previously declared in sites/all/modules/views/drush/views.drush.inc:45) in sites/all/modules/views/drush/views_revert.drush.inc on line 109

That error might be related to the fact that I am also using the latest dev version of drush, but removing sites/all/modules/views/drush/views_revert.drush.inc file "fixed" it.
