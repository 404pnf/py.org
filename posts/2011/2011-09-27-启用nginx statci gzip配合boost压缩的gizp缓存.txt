启用nginx statci gzip配合boost压缩的gizp缓存

It needs to be enabled on server build by using ./configure --with-http\_gzip\_static\_module and then by using gzip\_static on; in the Nginx configuration file. In fact, I have always used this in my config, just didn't test it with my rewrites for Boost, contributed initially by Brian Mercer. Or maybe Brain tested it already and I overlooked that?
