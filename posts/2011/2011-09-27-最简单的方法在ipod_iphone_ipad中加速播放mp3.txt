# 最简单的方法在ipod iphone ipad中加速播放mp3

这些设备只支持对audibook加速，mp3导入后只被最为音乐。而加速播放对我很重要，因此我一直不用这类设备。 今天总算找到了一个简单方法加速： http://superuser.com/questions/27326/double-speed-playback-for-itunes 3 down vote Not quite the answer you asked for, but quite closely related and I hit this site when I was still looking for the following, so I thought a post here might do someone else a favor. After spending a while trying to get my mp3 lectures to play at double speed on my iPhone, I finally figured out the thing that iTunes uses to tell whether the file is a podcast or audiobook is a setting in: "File-> Get Info-> Options tab-> Media Kind" Set that to podcast or audiobook and voila, your iPhone will give you the option of 2x speed. This is great, because you can select a bunch of tracks and change the whole lot with a few clicks. 我测试成功了。现在ipod正式可以作为我的播放器了：）
