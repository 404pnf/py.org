# 如何备份服务器上装的软件列表 以便重装机器的时候使用

> I’m currently using plain rsync over SSH. I do 2 things to prepare my system before running rsync. First, I run dpkg --get-selections to dump a list of my installed Debian packages. When recovering my system, I can feed that file to dpkg --set-selections and then run apt-get dselect-upgrade to get all my packages set up as I had before. So, I put this in my crontab: > > # save apt selections 00 20 \* \* \* /usr/bin/dpkg --get-selections > /home/vinod/apt-settings/dpkg-selections source: http://www.kurup.org/blog/2004/01/02/backup-strategy/
