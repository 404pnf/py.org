# drupal中cron已经在运行了


>That error is triggered when the cron_semaphore variable is found. It's set when cron starts, and is deleted when cron ends, so if it's still there, cron is presumably still running. Except it wasn't really - the logs show the previous crons ended successfully.

> I dug into it a little further: drush vget cron_semaphore brought up the timestamp value of the last cron, like it was still set. But querying the `variables` table directly for cron_semaphore brought up nothing! That tipped me off to the problem - it was caching the variables array for too long.
